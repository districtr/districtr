<p>This module was created because of a lawsuit against Santa Clara's at-large
electoral system for City Council, which plaintiffs claim posed a structural
impediment to the election of Asian Americans. A district court in May 2018
ruled that the voting system violated the California Voting Rights Act (for more
information see

recommendations for alternative voting systems in Santa Clara.</p>

Decennial Census data. The source shapefile for this module, along with

<h2 id="missouri">Missouri</h2>

<p>The units used here are voting tabulation districts or VTDs. Data for this
module were obtained from the

In November 2018, Missouri passed a constitutional amendment that makes the
state demographer responsible for drawing the state's legislative districts,
rather than the state legislature itself. MGGG is currently working to compile a
more recent precinct shapefile with election results, but Missouri is a
notoriously difficult state to do this because of discrepancies between election
results reported by counties and the census provided VTDs.</p>

<p>In March 2019 the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Rucho v. Common
Cause, in which plaintiffs claim that North Carolina's remedial 2016
congressional map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The 2016 remedial
map had been drawn after the Supreme Court struck down two of the state's 2011
enacted congressional districts as unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. MGGG
and our collaborators filed an amicus brief which can be accessed
<a href="https://mggg.org/amicus">on our website</a>.</p>

<p>This module was created to aid in a paper,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09051">"Locating the representational baseline: Republicans in Massachusetts,"</a>
written by MGGG and collaborators. Despite Republicans usually gaining between
30% and 40% of the two-way vote share in statewide elections, Massachusetts has
not elected a Republican to the US House of Representatives since 1994. The
paper finds that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not the
result of gerrymandering or candidate availability, but rather is a factor of
the spatial distribution of Republican voters in the state.</p>
