<p>The precinct and congressional district shapefiles come from the Michigan Department of State through the <a href="http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2016-voting-precincts">State of Michigan GIS Open Data Portal</a>. Demographic data at the block level are from <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">IPUMS NHGIS</a>. Shapefiles for Michigan's state house and senate districts were downloaded from the US Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php">TIGER/Line Program</a>. Precinct level election data for 2016 were obtained from the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu">MIT Elections Data and Science Lab</a>. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/MI-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.</p>
