    The units used here are voting tabulation districts or VTDS. Data for this
    module were obtained from the North Carolina General Assembly and National
    Historic GIS (NHGIS). The VTD shapefile and election results were downloaded
    from the North Carolina General Assembly's
    <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/RnR/Redistricting/BaseData2016"
        >2016 Redistricting Reference Data</a
    >. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at
    the block level from <a href="https://www.nhgis.org">NHGIS</a>. The source
    shapefile for this module, along with additional information about
    processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization

    In March 2019 the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Rucho v. Common
    Cause, in which plaintiffs claim that North Carolina's remedial 2016
    congressional map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The 2016
    remedial map had been drawn after the Supreme Court struck down two of the
    state's 2011 enacted congressional districts as unconstitutional racial
    gerrymanders. MGGG and our collaborators filed an amicus brief which can be
    accessed <a href="https://mggg.org/amicus">on our website</a>.
