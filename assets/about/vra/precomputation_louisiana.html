    The Louisiana VRA dashboard allows you to explore districts in terms of their history of 
    offering effective opportunity to Black voters to elect candidates of choice.   We have 
    pre-computed some racially polarized voting statistics in order to facilitate this exploration.
    In particular, we use ecological inference (EI) to identify the Black candidates of choice in 
    statewide elections from 2015-2019.  Our EI runs are done at the statewide level using eiPack 
    (a Bayesian hierarchical model for RxC inference).  The confidence in correctly identifying the 
    candidate of choice depends on the number of times out of 1000 draws that the candidate had the 
    most Black votes.  In this case, we got 1000/1000 agreement for each identified candidate of 
    choice in both the primary and the general/runoff.  We also weight more recent elections more 
    heavily, and we put twice as much weight on elections in which the candidate of choice is 
    themselves Black-identified. This is in keeping with the way VRA attorneys treat some elections 
    as more probative (providing more persuasive evidence). For details about the construction of 
    the “effectiveness score,” see LINK.

    In Louisiana, the VRA dashboard investigates the effectiveness of districts for Black voters to
    elect candidates of choice with respect to 10 statewide elections between 2015-2019.  The
    table below shows these pre-computed factors for these election groups.

    When you’re drawing maps in the module, you can see the electoral history of the district as you
    draw by going to the VRA tab and selecting the district under “District details.”  We have 
    colored successful primary elections green.  Success for the Black candidate of choice is 
    assessed in a primary when that candidate either (a) receives a majority of votes in the 
    district you drew in that primary, or (b) comes in first or second in the primary, but no 
    candidate receives a majority.  Below that is a table showing the outcomes in the general 
    elections for those contests that went to a second round because no candidate got a statewide 
    majority.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the vote shares, we also show a “group control” factor.  This is the estimated
    share of the candidate’s support that came from Black voters, again using EI outputs.
