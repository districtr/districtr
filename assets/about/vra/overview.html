    The state VRA dashboards allow you to explore districts in terms of their history of 
    offering effective opportunity to minority voters to elect candidates of choice.   We have 
    pre-computed some racially polarized voting statistics in order to facilitate this exploration.
    In particular, we use ecological inference (EI) to identify the minority candidates of choice in 
    historical statewide elections.  Our EI runs are done at the statewide level using eiPack 
    (a Bayesian hierarchical model for RxC inference).  The confidence in correctly identifying the 
    candidate of choice depends on the number of times out of 1000 draws that the candidate had the 
    most votes by the minority group.   We also weight more recent elections more 
    heavily, and we put twice as much weight on elections in which the candidate of choice is 
    themselves identified as part of the minority group in question. This is in keeping with the way 
    VRA attorneys treat some elections as more probative (providing more persuasive evidence). For 
    details about the construction of the “effectiveness score,” see LINK.

    When you’re drawing maps in the module, you can see the electoral history of the district as you
    draw by going to the VRA tab and selecting the district under “District details.”  We have 
    colored successful primary elections green.  Success for the minority candidate of choice is 
    assessed in a primary when that candidate either (a) receives a majority of votes in the 
    district you drew in that primary, or (b) comes in first or second in the primary, but no 
    candidate receives a majority.  Below that are tables showing the outcomes in the run-off and 
    general elections for those contests, if there was one.

    In addition to the vote shares, we also show a “group control” factor.  This is the estimated
    share of the candidate’s support that came from minority voters, again using EI outputs.
