  In our maps, you draw your own districts and communities from a given set of units or building blocks.  Common building blocks that you’ll see in our modules are <b>precincts</b>, <b>block groups</b>, or <b>blocks</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Precincts</b> are the smallest unit at which vote counts are reported. (Usually these correspond one-to-one with polling places, where you actually go to cast a vote.) Therefore, precincts are the smallest unit to use when you care about accurate election results. In a map built from precincts, you can explore recent election results and visualize the partisan lean in your state. Precinct level data can be <a href="assets/the-data-for-districtr.pdf">notoriously difficult to collect</a>!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Block groups</b> and <b>blocks</b> are units created by the Census Bureau, with input from the states. Blocks, the smallest unit provided in the Census data, come with basic demographic data – total population and counts by race, ethnicity, and voting age population (VAP). Block groups are larger and are useful because they are the reporting units for the more detailed American Community Survey (ACS), which includes many social and economic variables. We’ve tried to determine the most suitable units for each map on a case-by-case basis.
