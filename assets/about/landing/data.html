    In our maps, you draw your own districts and communities from a given set of
    units or building blocks.  Common building blocks that youâ€™ll see in our
    modules are <b>precincts</b>, <b>block groups</b>, or <b>blocks</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Precincts</b> are the smallest unit at which vote counts are reported.
    (Usually these correspond one-to-one with polling places, where you actually
    go to cast a vote.) Therefore, precincts are the smallest unit to use when
    you care about accurate election results. In a map built from precincts, you
    can explore recent election results and visualize the partisan lean in your
    state. Precinct level data can be <a href="assets/the-data-for-districtr.pdf">
    notoriously difficult to collect</a>!

<p>
    <b>Blocks</b> and <b>block groups</b> are units created by the United States
    Census Bureau with input from individual states. <b>Blocks</b> are the smallest
    geographic unit published by the Census Bureau, and attempt to fit neatly
    into the geographic features of their surroundings (e.g. interstate highways,
    rivers, city blocks etc.) while <b>block groups</b> are formed by grouping blocks
    together such that no two block groups share a block. The Census Bureau
    publishes geographic products, including revised block and block group
    geographies at least every decennial census, in accordance
    with <a href="https://bit.ly/2QczeID">Public Law 94-171</a>.

<p>
    The <strong>Decennial Census</strong> is the nationwide tallying of every
    person living in the United States, and has been conducted every ten years
    since 1790. The final Census product is an extremely large dataset, with more
    than 18,000 tabulated variables, and is published at the block level.
    The <strong>American Community Survey (ACS) </strong> is another large dataset
    produced by the United States Census Bureau. To collect data, the Census
    Bureau surveys approximately 3.5 million households across the United States
    each year, and produces two data products from this survey:
    <b>1-year estimates</b> and <b>5-year estimates</b>. <b>1-year estimates</b>
    are estimated population statistics published for Census-designated areas
    with 65,000 people or more, and so is unsuitable for redistricting. The
    <b>5-year estimates</b> are estimated population statistics, including
    income and some demographic data, and are published at the block group
    level regardless of population.
