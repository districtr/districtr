   A combination of national, state, and local rules guide the redistricting process. While the federal requirements apply universally, state and local governments can establish additional constraints and priorities.
</p>
<p>
  The rules are complicated and sometimes quite vague!  Here is a short explainer.

<table class="rules">
  <caption>Federal Requirements</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Population balance</b>: Districts should have very close to the same population</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/equalpop.png"  alt="Population Balance Diagram" border=0 width=150></img></td>
    <td><b>Voting Rights Act compliance</b>: Districts cannot block minority groups from electing candidates of choice</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/vra.png"  alt="" border=0 width=150></img></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table class="rules">
  <caption>Common State and Local Requirements</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Communities of Interest</b>: Groups with significant shared interests should be kept together</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/farmers - coi.png"  alt="" border=0 width=150></img></td>
    <td><b>Contiguity</b>: Each district should be one connected piece</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/nesting - contiguity.png"  alt="" border=0 width=150></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Compactness</b>: District shapes should be “reasonable”</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/compactness.png"  alt="" border=0 width=150></img></td>
    <td><b>Boundary preservation</b>: District lines should follow natural and official boundaries, such as rivers or town and county borders</td>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/landing/rules_images/boundary_pres.png"  alt="" border=0 width=150></img></td>
  </tr>
</table>
