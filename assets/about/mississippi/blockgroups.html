<p>
    The units used here are census block groups. Data for this module were
    obtained from the US Census Bureau. The block group shapefile for
    Mississippi was downloaded from the Census's
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html"
        >TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a
    >. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at
    the block level from
    <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml"
        >American FactFinder</a
    >. The source shapefile with demographic information is available for
    download from MGGG's GitHub organization
    <a

    This Mississippi module comes out of a project from MGGG's Voting Rights
    Data Institute that explored how many majority-Black congressional districts
    are possible to draw. A write-up of this experiment is forthcoming.
