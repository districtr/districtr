    The raw, unprocessed 2020 VTDs were collected from the Census <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>. Election data was compiled and derived from <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/electionscience">VEST</a>'s 2016 and 2018 precinct-level election results. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the block level from <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">American FactFinder</a>, as well as 2019 5-year ACS Census data. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/PA-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.
