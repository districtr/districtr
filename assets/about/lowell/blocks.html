    The units you see here are census blocks. Data for this module were obtained
    from the US Census Bureau. The block shapefile for the City of Lowell was
    downloaded from the Census
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html"
        >TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a
    >. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at
    the block level from
    <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml"
        >American FactFinder</a
    >. The source shapefile with demographic information is available for
    download from MGGG's GitHub organization

    This module was created in response to the current lawsuit (Huot et al. v.
    City of Lowell et al.) challenging the City of Lowell's at-large electoral
    system for City Council and School Committee. Plaintiffs in the case argue
    that the current system dilutes the votes of Lowell's communities of color.
