<p>The Maine precinct shapefile was obtained from the <a href="https://www.maine.gov/geolib/catalog.html">Maine Geolibrary</a> and processed by
students in Diana Davisâ€™s Districting Data REU. This effort was led by Jorge Lopez-Nava and Katie Knox and included Nathaniel Cox, Angus Lam, Jennifer Paige, Nathan Pitock, Powell Sheagren, and Victoria Song. Additional processing was done by MGGG staff.
Election data come from the <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html">Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections, & Commissions</a>. Data from absentee votes reported at the state level were disaggregated by voting age population. Because of data reporting and processing, a few precincts cross county boundaries.  Demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>.  More information about our data sources and processing can be found <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/ME-shapefiles">here</a>.</p>
