Only one family has small children. My youngest is 13. It doesn't appear that many of us are home very often. We all seem to have more than one job. One of my biggest complaints is the waste management here. We definitely need roll carts. Every trash pick up, there's garbage in the streets and in people's yards because animals get into the bags or whatever. There's a few places you can walk to. There's two liquor stores, a mile apart from each other, in either direction. We also have a new gas station, car wash and one of the said liquor stores. They are rapidly building more apartments in that area, as well. I see people walking in the mornings and evenings. I tend to be out in the mornings, with other dog walkers. We had a garden last year but have been way to busy for that this year. However, the farmer's market is not too far but you've gotta drive there from our neighborhood. The city took out the bus stop in our area, which is unfortunate, especially now that there are more places to go in that neighborhood. It feels like a basic, normal, middleclass neighborhood. We don't go to church and I don't think our neighbors do either. We try to be on rivers and lakes anytime we have a free weekend. We used to grill outside and have friends and family over. We noticed the neighbors doing the same. COVID definitely changed that. We are all vaccinated but we still use caution.  I work in Fulton and have about a 45 minute commute. I think most of the people around me live and work in Columbia. We were pretty close with the neighbors that lived on the other side of our duplex but they just moved and bought a house. It's not a new development. I believe it was probably built sometime in the 80's and has had some renovations. We are renters. I wish we had a fenced in back yard but that's not going to happen until we buy our own home. It kind of feels like everyone living in these duplexes, looks at our housing as temporary, until we find what we want. They're pretty basic but functional. One thing that does bring us all together is our hatred of the trash system.

School system attracts quality teachers, board of education has won several statewide awards for its leadership. Nixa was formerly a sleepy, small town but for last 35 years has grown to a mix of \"hometowners\" and people who work in Springfield, about nine miles to the north. This growth is due to excellent public schools and rapid housing development  In the 1990s Nixa school district was fastest growing school district in Missouri. Today, growth has slowed a bit--but not much. City government has been future oriented: Nixa Public Building Corporation was established about 1990 to issue bonds for a much-needed new City Hall; a fee was created whereby landlords pay for a city inspection each time the tenant changes making sure the rental is safe and meets building codes; Nixa City Council imposed a facial mask requirement during Covid that withstood some public opposition. County government has a history of cooperation with Nixa, one of the two largest cities in the county, especially in the area of economic development. City of Nixa has successfully courted gigabit speed internet for residents and business. The City purchases power from a 72-acre solar farm constructed in 2017. Nixa struggles to attract new business though a newly reenergized Chamber of Commerce is helping. The Nixa region considers itself autonomous in spite of its dependence on Springfield and Greene County for health care, higher education and entertainment. Residents of the Nixa region are proud to be Christian Countians.
