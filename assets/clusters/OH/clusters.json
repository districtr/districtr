Unfortunately, our population is currently declining at a rate of -0.66% annually and the population has decreased by -4.13% since the most recent census, which recorded a population of 60,608 in 2010. The average household income in Springfield is $51,534 with a poverty rate of 23.14%. The median rental costs in recent years comes to $730 per month, and the median house value is $80,700. The median age in Springfield is 35.8 years, 34.5 years for males, and 37 years for females. A partial demographic of Springfield includes: White: 74.92%, Black or African American: 17.17%, Two or more races: 5.96%. Educationally, 40.18% of the population have attained a high school diploma while 21.96% have attained some level of higher education. Most people work in Springfield, but a large number work elsewhere. Occupations include manufacturing, retail, government, and health care.  Evangelical Christians predominate yet there a is a large Islamic Mosque and a very active Muslim community. Although Springfield would be considered more middle of the road, more conservative than some counties that surround us, there is some level of diversity which has been accepted and relationships abound across various lines.  Springfield has many positive attributes. Uppermost is the many Springfield residents who have deep roots in the community that go back several generations. One can go downtown for coffee, a meal, and a tour of the Heritage Center. We have an excellent library and numerous places of worship. Our heritage as a major industrial city remains evident in our historic area and in our relationship with IH/Navistar. Springfield has segments of our citizens who are passionate about making our city a more vibrant place to live. We have seen the fruits of their endeavors especially in recent years  in their efforts to revitalize our downtown with openings of retail businesses, a new hospital and many art and cultural events that bring people together and provide for both performers and audiences as well.  Springfield has a Summer Arts Festival at the Veterans Park (which is part of National Trail Parks & Recreation District) that can boast an  annual attendance of several hundred people 5 nights/week for 4-6 weeks each summer. Other free or lost cost events include our annual CultureFest, the Farmers Market, a global education series implemented after  9/11, and an annual Pride Festival. Many parks and bike trails are available in our community that provide individuals and families opportunities for recreation, to be outdoors, and to learn about nature.  Springfield has many citizens who are willing to look at themselves and envision ways to make things better. For example, a \"Beloved Community series\" was brought together in efforts to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity (DIA). We have a Peace Camp for kids every summer that has been in operation for 35 years (with the exception of 2020 due to Covid).    Springfield is also extremely fortunate to have a responsive city government and city officials that recently responded with openness after the murder of George Floyd. Both the city and the county responded by forming police advisory committees. More challenging, yet eventually accomplished was the passing of a non-discrimination ordinance.  Though Springfield is consistently addressing issues in our city, there are specific areas of ongoing concern.  There historically has been a division between the north end and the south end of Springfield and between the county and the city.  Though we believe the majority of our citizens have many positive attributes, and desire a good quality of life for all, the division between the quadrants is seen as a competition for scare resources and a disparity in growth rather than a shared planning for the common good. More resources tend to be in the northwest quadrant than the others. For example, there was a community pool which was centralized  & easily accessible to many of the citizens of Springfield. It was replaced by an upgraded water park that is much less accessible for those in the southeast and southwest quadrant. Another example of the disparity between sections of the city is the closing of a major grocery store in 2020 which was a great loss for citizens in the southwest and southeast quadrants. Many other concerns which affect the quality of life for the southeast  & southwest quadrants and thus continue to need addressed include poverty, homelessness, gun violence and crime, drugs, public education that is not equitable across the board, affordable and accessible healthcare, and an insufficient public transportation system.  Though Springfield does have many cultural and recreational opportunities, those quadrants with insufficient public transportation or lower income are unable to access these as they would want. Recently, a zoom meeting was conducted regarding the gun violence in our city. Participants learned that our police force does not have the financial resources for body cams.  The availability of jobs presents another significant challenge. Younger people tend to migrate to Columbus and to other large cities that provide many more opportunities for employment as well as higher salaries. Additionally, Springfield has a significant number of ex-offenders who are unable to find jobs due the \"black mark\" on their record.

Mix of young couples with children, students (OSU), recently graduated college students, older people who have lived in the neighborhood for quite some time. A real diversity in terms of age, but not race (yet). You see a few Black people and a few Latino people, but, mostly white. A mix of apartments and single family homes. All of retired people and younger people (20s-30s) mixed bag of white collar jobs and do-whatever-you-can jobs. Fairly significant portion of people with college degrees among younger folks (20s-30s). English is the most commonly spoken language. Pedestrian friendly neighborhood. A lot of people, including young people and young couples, walk dogs throughout the neighborhood, especially in the morning and after work.   From a city standpoint, it's a small section of Columbus, surrounded by Lennox Township and Upper Arlington and Grandview Heights/Marble Cliff. Results in some delays in things like snow removal and other weather related services. Garbage pick ups and recycling services work well. Sewer run-off does occur. Rain gardens and other environmental projects are slated for 2023.   Young folks are transient. Makes canvassing/elections difficult. Residential turn-over makes it difficult to get attention from city officials.   Schools are a problem. May be a problem with young folks staying in the neighborhood because there are no public schools (Columbus Public Schools) very close by. They have to be bussed. Not a lot of kids in the neighborhood. But in Grandview Heights, they have a lot of retirees but younger families with kids because of a highly regarded school system, small class sizes. If kids don't go to Trinity Catholic, which is technically in Columbus, then you have to be bussed. Grandview High School is within walking distance of 5th by Northwest, but unsure if children could attend those schools.   As a result of the trendiness of Grandview, housing prices have been trending upward. Two bedroom houses, flipped by investors, are selling four 345,000 or upwards towards 400,000. Even though the community is adjacent to Grandview. Housing is more expensive in Grandview due to good schools. A lot of development over the last 20 years, especially apartments. Grandview Yard is a big development (Nationwide offices and apartments). Grandview Yard is an expensive apartment complex (1,000 for a studio). Some of the older red brick townhouses or quadplexes have also gone up in rent due to desirability. A few places have been bought by the Housing Coalition for subsided housing for people with mental disabilities. More subsided housing  on the east side of the neighborhood (Good Will Career Center), meal services are also delivered to the Good Will Career Center. There is a subsided apartment complex for vets with PTSD.   Low crime rate. Violent crime is incredibly lower, property crimes are also very low. NextDoor App is used by people in neighboring communities (Victorian Village/Harrison West). Contrast of comments between 5th by Northwest (lost pets) and Harrison West (robberies, property destruction, assault). Harrison West/Victorian Village has become very gentrified. University District and Short North are nearby. Lennox. Township is very quiet. Not a lot of outside traffic in 5th by Northwest. Not a lot of wild post football game partying, a couple of bars (Woodland Tavern, Meisters), some traffic on the weekends for the bars.

It is in the middle of an agricultural region producing feed corn, wheat, and soybeans. Water comes from the Maumee River. There are several electricity windmills which are a public utility. Bowling Green was once an oil boom town in the 19th century. Bowling Green was once called the Crystal City because sugar beets were once a major crop of the region.   Folks work for the university community, faculty come from all over the country to work at Bowling Green. A substantial number of children leave Bowling Green and go elsewhere. The school system is considered pretty good, school board arguments over consolidation of elementary schools, despite there only being one junior high and one high school. Rural folks did not want to pay higher taxes and created a rural/urban divide.   Folks work at the university, in smaller manufacturing centers such as Cooper Tire, folks from smaller towns in Wood County commute into Bowling Green to work. Bowling Green is the county seat of Wood County with a beautiful historic court house.   Downtown Bowling Green is a popular destination. John Kerry and John Edwards came to campaign in Bowling Green. The Downtown region has moved away from retail and more towards an entertainment district. Big box stores have moved in and detracted business away from downtown.   The Bowling Green Parks Department is well-funded and the parks are well-maintained including a grove of old oak trees. Oldest park includes a public pool with other aquatic centers. Golf course and picnic area is also nearby.   Lots of Protestant churches as well as a large Catholic church and parish. The Catholic church has school and there is a conservative Christian school as well. City Council passed a non-discrimination policy for employment and the Christian school came out and prevent us from hiring teachers who adhered to our mission.   The City Council was about to pass a plastic bag ban ordinance and then the state placed a ban on banning plastic bags. Curbside recycling pickup and curbside composting are in town.   The on-going issues with the school infrastructure, including being old and have no A/C, a concern with climate change and COVID.   City council is working to make bike lanes more accessible and safer, city historic preservation is a priority, zoning updating is underway, drafting a resolution for a sustainability plan.   There is no public transportation. There is ride sharing and the University has some bussing. A former Mayor took interest in partnering with the University to have a general bussing system. The University turned down the offer.   Drunk students are the main source of crime, otherwise it is a very safe town. The local paper has suffered in recent years. A local law enforcement officer has been opposing the city's Human Right's Council over discrimination. There have been incidents of discrimination, including discrimination against Black Lives Matter initiatives. The police force has not been helpful to folks who are gender non-conforming.   Water pollution is a concern with the Maumee River with the agricultural areas surrounding Bowling Green. Folks from Toledo have come to Bowling Green to get clean drinking water after incidents in Toledo. City Council does have a sustainability plan to curb green house gas emissions.  People are increasingly concerned with climate change and the weather. Down pours of rain this summer and the region is known as the Great Black Swamp. A lot of the agricultural communities depend on drainage with a system of tiling.   Affordable housing is a problem. A starter home priced home is being outbid by landlords who convert them to rentals for college students.  Affordable housing development have gone up but are separate from the historic downtown, desirable areas.   Social services: there is a very nice mental health public health agency, deals with a lot of people who would be in need of housing.

Its population density is the highest of any city in Ohio and is roughly comparable to that of Washington, D.C.  The city has a very strong sense of community, progressiveness, and DIY culture. The City of Lakewood first introduced curbside recycling in 1989 and has one of the highest recycling rates in all of Ohio: 79% in 2009. A handful of print and online media chronicle Lakewood, including LakewoodBuzz.com, a Lakewood channel of Patch.com, The Sun Post-Herald, and The Lakewood Observer.  Lakewood has the highest concentration of vegetarians and vegans in northeast Ohio.* Historical housing throughout the city and an active historical society are the norm in Lakewood. The \u201cMake Lakewood Beautiful\" program involves contests in which residents compete to make their homes look and resemble their original design and architecture, and awards are given to several homeowners each year.

Residents can boat, fish and swim on Lake Erie and take advantage of nine City parks and the Metroparks for woods, playground equipment, picnicking, fishing and countless other activities.  From the time of arrival of the first permanent settlers in about 1810, the City of Rocky River, then an agricultural community, was variously called Granger City, Riverbank, Rockport and Rocky River Hamlet. Incorporated as a hamlet in 1893, it became a village in 1903 when the first mayor, Mark Mitchell , and a council were elected.  A 1960 charter adopted the mayor-council government. Rocky River is named after the river which, in turn, was named by the Native Americans who camped and stored their canoes on the island at the mouth of the winding river, now part of the Cleveland Metroparks System.  Today, Rocky River has beautiful residential homes, some along the Lake; new residential developments including clusters homes and townhouses; a wide variety of retail businesses for shopping; corporate facilities as well as other commercial developments; two theaters; many restaurants; and two private clubs (Westwood Country Club and Cleveland Yachting Club).

Zoning requires that a lot must be five acres and there is a stated goal to maintain the rural feel of the community.    History of Guilford Township from the Township website Guilford township was originally know as Township Number 14, Range 14W of the Connecticut Western Reserve was one of the first townships organized after the creation of the county in 1818.  Guilford Township was organized in 1819, one year following our adjoining township \u2013 Wadsworth, to the East and one year before our adjoining townships \u2013 Montville and Westfield, to the North and West.  Guilford Township was formerly divided into four quarters, owned by four Easterners: Roger Newbury of Windham, Connecticut; Justin Ely of Springfield, Massachusetts; Enoch Perkins of Hartford, Connecticut; and Elyah White of Hudson, Connecticut.  Two brothers, John and David Wilson, made the first opening in the Northwest quarter of the Township in 1816. In the same year, William Moore cleared a small tract in the Northwest quarter about one mile East of Chippewa Creek.  The first permanent settlers in the Township, however, were Henry and Chester Hosmer, Shubael and Abigail Porter, Lyman Munson and Moses Noble, who came from Massachusetts in February 1817. The men of the party built a log house oh the South of the Hubbard Creek, and on the 1st of March, 1817, the entire colony moved into it as their abiding place.  In 1821 the first log schoolhouse in the township was erected just West of the state road. This pioneer schoolhouse was burned down in 1822. In 1823, a second and quite similar building replaced it.  In 1824, the present burying grounds, just East f Seville, were surveyed and deeded to the Township. The first burial therein was Mrs. Harriet Wilson, wife of Robert Wilson, who died during the year of the survey.  In 1825, a mail route was established between New Hampshire, Huron County, and new Portage, Portage County. Mr. Hosmer was appointed the first Postmaster at Guilford.  At this writing (January 1987), the original mail sorting cupboard that Mr Hosmer used to keep the mail organized and moving is on display at the Seville Historical Society Museum in Seville, as are many of the history-making memorabilia of Guilford Township and Seville Village.  In 1828, Henry Hosmer, Proprietor of the land at this point, called upon Nathaniel Bell, then County Surveyor, to plot a town to which he gave the name of Seville. At that period, Guildford had two regular mail routes, an excellent Tavern kept by Dr. Eastman, a schoolhouse, a store, a blacksmith shop, a sawmill, and boaster numerous farmers who had already quite a substantial position in life. Thus may be traced the main cause of the birth of Seville as a village.  It is well at this time to give some explanation of the names of our other villages. Each one had a name given it descriptive of its citizens or its industry.  Acme was formerly Millersburg, named from the pioneer family of Samuel Miller. Blake had gone under the name of Steamtown, deriving its name from the sawmill, cider mill, and blacksmith shop. A new name was needed for this village to supply it with a better name for its post office. The name of Blake was chosen, being named, it is said, for the Honorable G. G. Blake of Medina.  River Styx had long borne the name of Wilson\u2019s Corners, but due to the fact that another village in the state had a prior claim on the name, the present name was made official. To justify this name, mythologically minded settlers pointed out that South of the settlement was an impenetrable swamp, infested with black rattlesnakes, a menace to immigrants and their covered wagons.  Not long after the settlement of these rural communities, the need for churches was felt. A Methodist Church was built on Mr. D. Wilson\u2019s farm, just East of the corner, and across the road from where it was later moved.  The Mennonite Denomination bought a brick schoolhouse further East of this place of worship.  One of the finest examples of the rural church is that of the Jerusalem Lutheran Church at Acme. With its several hundred members, its pipe organ and organizations make it one of the finest rural churches in Medina County.  J.L. Beck, a farmer just South of River Styx, built a church at Guilford Center, where many worshiped for many years. At the death of Mr. Beck, the church was left to the Township with the stipulation that the grounds, and in truth, the \u201cGod\u2019s Acre\u201d, be kept as beautiful as a burial place could be.  Next in order are two Mennonite Churches in South Guilford: the lower Mennonite Church, with its large cemetery adjoining, and the Bethel Mennonite Church, a daughter of the lower church.  Another Mennonite Church, West of Blake, was in existence for many years with a well-kept burial plot adjoining. The church was later sold and taken away, so there is no church at Blake now.  Industry played a large part in Guilford Township, such as the Match Factory, built and run by John Wilson at River Styx. John purchased the formula from a German peddler. Lowell Thomas, a news broadcaster, referred to River Styx in one of his broadcasts as \u201cthe cradle of the match industry in America\u201d. The factory was later sold to Barber, who then located in Middlebury, now East Akron.  Thomas Palmer, from Cleveland, started a creamery in Guilford. In time the creamery venture fell through and was purchased by the Harter Brothers of Western Star, proving very successful. A branch was begun in Medina and eventually became \u201cThe Akron Pure Milk Company\u201d. When they died, each partner was listed as being worth a million dollars.  A stone quarry, in the Northern and Eastern part of Guilford Township, was opened in the early period of the development of Guilford and soon became a thriving business. Many large barns and stone houses have stone cut from this quarry.  Guilford Township has produced many professional persons. For example:           Honorable J.C. Johnson           Honorable A.D. Licey, State Representative           Judge Albert Munson, born on a farm near River Styx, 1829           John Beck, an organist of national fame, born in Blake           Melville Wilson, master musician on the cello and coronet, who traveled to                               Europe as a special soloist  The shoemakers who made shoes, both heavy and strong, have gone the way that shoemakers do, and the blacksmith\u2019s anvil is silent, but still our valley of Guilford moves on with good people, good food, fine wine, law-abiding citizens that want it that way.  With the great change in mode of travel throughout the country, the government felt the need to lay out a large network of interstate highways, two of which were scheduled to go through Guilford Township.  From East to West, Rt. I-76 (224) was constructed through nearly all farmland. In fact, this highway took up well over 130 acres. Then from Southwest to Northeast, Rt. I-71 was constructed, consuming 84.50 plus acres, also of mostly farmland.  With these two new highways and the industries booming in the cities with a 65-mile radius, the population started to increase in the townships. New homes were built on nearly every road in the township. Gasoline stations cropped up at Rts. 76 and 3, campgrounds came into being, a large auto dealership was built, a golf course in the southeast section of the township, an airport ad housing complex was built at Acme. Land was annexed into the village of Seville to allow room for more industry; Muehler Packing Co., now Ohio Wholesale, and Jaffy Shoe Co. were soon on the move and employing more and more people. More land was annexed to the village to make room for a housing complex on the Southeast corner of Rts. 3 and 97 (old 224).  Another annexation on the North side of 97, just east of Rt. 3 brought a small shopping plaza and grocery-drug store to the village along with another housing complex.  With the annexations, expansions, and population growth in the village, growing pains were bound to come. A large problem is facing the village at this time. The sewage system, the EPA says, in inadequate to handle the added amounts of sewage and run-off, and needs to be updated again. This is foremost in the minds of the Board of Public Affairs of Seville, and Village Council, who are trying to resolve the situation.  With the mechanization of farming coming into the farming picture in the early 1950\u2019s, farmers were able to till more acreage and increase production. Larger horsepower tractors with equipment to match, self-propelled combines and harvesters, automatic balers, silo unloaders, automated feeding systems, bulk milk cooling and storage tanks, milking parlors, all played a great roll in the unsurpassed achievement of farming the farmers of Guilford Township are doing today.  With the smaller sized farm staying at around 90 acres and 25 milk cows, and ranging up to one of the largest dairies in the State of Ohio with 500 milk cows and 400 head coming up as replacements, and farming approximately 1,610 acres, in and out of the township, this operation is a family enterprise, one of many that has sprung up in the county. Guilford farmers can hold their heads high and not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to fulfilling the task of doing their share in the largest industry in the country; agriculture.  Not only do we have fine farms and farmers, we can also boast one of the largest maple syrup making operations in the county, if not the state. The Maple Valley Farms of Guilford Township is a family affair and is now in the fourth generation with the fifth generation just in the tasting stage, but coming on strong.  Then too, we must not forget the large watershed control dam of Hubbard Cheek \u2013 Hubbard Valley Park. This project controls the waters from the North central part of the township and keeps the waters at a more controlled level when meeting the Chippewa Creek waters at the Village of Seville, thus keeping the village less apt to flood as was known to occur in the past.  With progress and changes happening nearly every few months, Guilford Township keeps moving forward in making it a great place to live.

History of Guilford Township from the Township website Guilford township was originally know as Township Number 14, Range 14W of the Connecticut Western Reserve was one of the first townships organized after the creation of the county in 1818.  Guilford Township was organized in 1819, one year following our adjoining township \u2013 Wadsworth, to the East and one year before our adjoining townships \u2013 Montville and Westfield, to the North and West.  Guilford Township was formerly divided into four quarters, owned by four Easterners: Roger Newbury of Windham, Connecticut; Justin Ely of Springfield, Massachusetts; Enoch Perkins of Hartford, Connecticut; and Elyah White of Hudson, Connecticut.  Two brothers, John and David Wilson, made the first opening in the Northwest quarter of the Township in 1816. In the same year, William Moore cleared a small tract in the Northwest quarter about one mile East of Chippewa Creek.  The first permanent settlers in the Township, however, were Henry and Chester Hosmer, Shubael and Abigail Porter, Lyman Munson and Moses Noble, who came from Massachusetts in February 1817. The men of the party built a log house oh the South of the Hubbard Creek, and on the 1st of March, 1817, the entire colony moved into it as their abiding place.  In 1821 the first log schoolhouse in the township was erected just West of the state road. This pioneer schoolhouse was burned down in 1822. In 1823, a second and quite similar building replaced it.  In 1824, the present burying grounds, just East f Seville, were surveyed and deeded to the Township. The first burial therein was Mrs. Harriet Wilson, wife of Robert Wilson, who died during the year of the survey.  In 1825, a mail route was established between New Hampshire, Huron County, and new Portage, Portage County. Mr. Hosmer was appointed the first Postmaster at Guilford.  At this writing (January 1987), the original mail sorting cupboard that Mr Hosmer used to keep the mail organized and moving is on display at the Seville Historical Society Museum in Seville, as are many of the history-making memorabilia of Guilford Township and Seville Village.  In 1828, Henry Hosmer, Proprietor of the land at this point, called upon Nathaniel Bell, then County Surveyor, to plot a town to which he gave the name of Seville. At that period, Guildford had two regular mail routes, an excellent Tavern kept by Dr. Eastman, a schoolhouse, a store, a blacksmith shop, a sawmill, and boaster numerous farmers who had already quite a substantial position in life. Thus may be traced the main cause of the birth of Seville as a village.  It is well at this time to give some explanation of the names of our other villages. Each one had a name given it descriptive of its citizens or its industry.  Acme was formerly Millersburg, named from the pioneer family of Samuel Miller. Blake had gone under the name of Steamtown, deriving its name from the sawmill, cider mill, and blacksmith shop. A new name was needed for this village to supply it with a better name for its post office. The name of Blake was chosen, being named, it is said, for the Honorable G. G. Blake of Medina.  River Styx had long borne the name of Wilson\u2019s Corners, but due to the fact that another village in the state had a prior claim on the name, the present name was made official. To justify this name, mythologically minded settlers pointed out that South of the settlement was an impenetrable swamp, infested with black rattlesnakes, a menace to immigrants and their covered wagons.  Not long after the settlement of these rural communities, the need for churches was felt. A Methodist Church was built on Mr. D. Wilson\u2019s farm, just East of the corner, and across the road from where it was later moved.  The Mennonite Denomination bought a brick schoolhouse further East of this place of worship.  One of the finest examples of the rural church is that of the Jerusalem Lutheran Church at Acme. With its several hundred members, its pipe organ and organizations make it one of the finest rural churches in Medina County.  J.L. Beck, a farmer just South of River Styx, built a church at Guilford Center, where many worshiped for many years. At the death of Mr. Beck, the church was left to the Township with the stipulation that the grounds, and in truth, the \u201cGod\u2019s Acre\u201d, be kept as beautiful as a burial place could be.  Next in order are two Mennonite Churches in South Guilford: the lower Mennonite Church, with its large cemetery adjoining, and the Bethel Mennonite Church, a daughter of the lower church.  Another Mennonite Church, West of Blake, was in existence for many years with a well-kept burial plot adjoining. The church was later sold and taken away, so there is no church at Blake now.  Industry played a large part in Guilford Township, such as the Match Factory, built and run by John Wilson at River Styx. John purchased the formula from a German peddler. Lowell Thomas, a news broadcaster, referred to River Styx in one of his broadcasts as \u201cthe cradle of the match industry in America\u201d. The factory was later sold to Barber, who then located in Middlebury, now East Akron.  Thomas Palmer, from Cleveland, started a creamery in Guilford. In time the creamery venture fell through and was purchased by the Harter Brothers of Western Star, proving very successful. A branch was begun in Medina and eventually became \u201cThe Akron Pure Milk Company\u201d. When they died, each partner was listed as being worth a million dollars.  A stone quarry, in the Northern and Eastern part of Guilford Township, was opened in the early period of the development of Guilford and soon became a thriving business. Many large barns and stone houses have stone cut from this quarry.  Guilford Township has produced many professional persons. For example:           Honorable J.C. Johnson           Honorable A.D. Licey, State Representative           Judge Albert Munson, born on a farm near River Styx, 1829           John Beck, an organist of national fame, born in Blake           Melville Wilson, master musician on the cello and coronet, who traveled to                               Europe as a special soloist  The shoemakers who made shoes, both heavy and strong, have gone the way that shoemakers do, and the blacksmith\u2019s anvil is silent, but still our valley of Guilford moves on with good people, good food, fine wine, law-abiding citizens that want it that way.  With the great change in mode of travel throughout the country, the government felt the need to lay out a large network of interstate highways, two of which were scheduled to go through Guilford Township.  From East to West, Rt. I-76 (224) was constructed through nearly all farmland. In fact, this highway took up well over 130 acres. Then from Southwest to Northeast, Rt. I-71 was constructed, consuming 84.50 plus acres, also of mostly farmland.  With these two new highways and the industries booming in the cities with a 65-mile radius, the population started to increase in the townships. New homes were built on nearly every road in the township. Gasoline stations cropped up at Rts. 76 and 3, campgrounds came into being, a large auto dealership was built, a golf course in the southeast section of the township, an airport ad housing complex was built at Acme. Land was annexed into the village of Seville to allow room for more industry; Muehler Packing Co., now Ohio Wholesale, and Jaffy Shoe Co. were soon on the move and employing more and more people. More land was annexed to the village to make room for a housing complex on the Southeast corner of Rts. 3 and 97 (old 224).  Another annexation on the North side of 97, just east of Rt. 3 brought a small shopping plaza and grocery-drug store to the village along with another housing complex.  With the annexations, expansions, and population growth in the village, growing pains were bound to come. A large problem is facing the village at this time. The sewage system, the EPA says, in inadequate to handle the added amounts of sewage and run-off, and needs to be updated again. This is foremost in the minds of the Board of Public Affairs of Seville, and Village Council, who are trying to resolve the situation.  With the mechanization of farming coming into the farming picture in the early 1950\u2019s, farmers were able to till more acreage and increase production. Larger horsepower tractors with equipment to match, self-propelled combines and harvesters, automatic balers, silo unloaders, automated feeding systems, bulk milk cooling and storage tanks, milking parlors, all played a great roll in the unsurpassed achievement of farming the farmers of Guilford Township are doing today.  With the smaller sized farm staying at around 90 acres and 25 milk cows, and ranging up to one of the largest dairies in the State of Ohio with 500 milk cows and 400 head coming up as replacements, and farming approximately 1,610 acres, in and out of the township, this operation is a family enterprise, one of many that has sprung up in the county. Guilford farmers can hold their heads high and not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to fulfilling the task of doing their share in the largest industry in the country; agriculture.  Not only do we have fine farms and farmers, we can also boast one of the largest maple syrup making operations in the county, if not the state. The Maple Valley Farms of Guilford Township is a family affair and is now in the fourth generation with the fifth generation just in the tasting stage, but coming on strong.  Then too, we must not forget the large watershed control dam of Hubbard Cheek \u2013 Hubbard Valley Park. This project controls the waters from the North central part of the township and keeps the waters at a more controlled level when meeting the Chippewa Creek waters at the Village of Seville, thus keeping the village less apt to flood as was known to occur in the past.  With progress and changes happening nearly every few months, Guilford Township keeps moving forward in making it a great place to live.

In 1828, Henry Hosmer, Proprietor of the land at this point, called upon Nathaniel Bell, then County Surveyor, to plot a town to which he gave the name of Seville. At that period, Guildford had two regular mail routes, an excellent Tavern kept by Dr. Eastman, a schoolhouse, a store, a blacksmith shop, a sawmill, and boaster numerous farmers who had already quite a substantial position in life. Thus may be traced the main cause of the birth of Seville as a village.  It is well at this time to give some explanation of the names of our other villages. Each one had a name given it descriptive of its citizens or its industry.  Acme was formerly Millersburg, named from the pioneer family of Samuel Miller. Blake had gone under the name of Steamtown, deriving its name from the sawmill, cider mill, and blacksmith shop. A new name was needed for this village to supply it with a better name for its post office. The name of Blake was chosen, being named, it is said, for the Honorable G. G. Blake of Medina.  River Styx had long borne the name of Wilson\u2019s Corners, but due to the fact that another village in the state had a prior claim on the name, the present name was made official. To justify this name, mythologically minded settlers pointed out that South of the settlement was an impenetrable swamp, infested with black rattlesnakes, a menace to immigrants and their covered wagons.  Not long after the settlement of these rural communities, the need for churches was felt. A Methodist Church was built on Mr. D. Wilson\u2019s farm, just East of the corner, and across the road from where it was later moved.  The Mennonite Denomination bought a brick schoolhouse further East of this place of worship.  One of the finest examples of the rural church is that of the Jerusalem Lutheran Church at Acme. With its several hundred members, its pipe organ and organizations make it one of the finest rural churches in Medina County.  J.L. Beck, a farmer just South of River Styx, built a church at Guilford Center, where many worshiped for many years. At the death of Mr. Beck, the church was left to the Township with the stipulation that the grounds, and in truth, the \u201cGod\u2019s Acre\u201d, be kept as beautiful as a burial place could be.  Next in order are two Mennonite Churches in South Guilford: the lower Mennonite Church, with its large cemetery adjoining, and the Bethel Mennonite Church, a daughter of the lower church.  Another Mennonite Church, West of Blake, was in existence for many years with a well-kept burial plot adjoining. The church was later sold and taken away, so there is no church at Blake now.  Industry played a large part in Guilford Township, such as the Match Factory, built and run by John Wilson at River Styx. John purchased the formula from a German peddler. Lowell Thomas, a news broadcaster, referred to River Styx in one of his broadcasts as \u201cthe cradle of the match industry in America\u201d. The factory was later sold to Barber, who then located in Middlebury, now East Akron.  Thomas Palmer, from Cleveland, started a creamery in Guilford. In time the creamery venture fell through and was purchased by the Harter Brothers of Western Star, proving very successful. A branch was begun in Medina and eventually became \u201cThe Akron Pure Milk Company\u201d. When they died, each partner was listed as being worth a million dollars.  A stone quarry, in the Northern and Eastern part of Guilford Township, was opened in the early period of the development of Guilford and soon became a thriving business. Many large barns and stone houses have stone cut from this quarry.  Guilford Township has produced many professional persons. For example:           Honorable J.C. Johnson           Honorable A.D. Licey, State Representative           Judge Albert Munson, born on a farm near River Styx, 1829           John Beck, an organist of national fame, born in Blake           Melville Wilson, master musician on the cello and coronet, who traveled to                               Europe as a special soloist  The shoemakers who made shoes, both heavy and strong, have gone the way that shoemakers do, and the blacksmith\u2019s anvil is silent, but still our valley of Guilford moves on with good people, good food, fine wine, law-abiding citizens that want it that way.  With the great change in mode of travel throughout the country, the government felt the need to lay out a large network of interstate highways, two of which were scheduled to go through Guilford Township.  From East to West, Rt. I-76 (224) was constructed through nearly all farmland. In fact, this highway took up well over 130 acres. Then from Southwest to Northeast, Rt. I-71 was constructed, consuming 84.50 plus acres, also of mostly farmland.  With these two new highways and the industries booming in the cities with a 65-mile radius, the population started to increase in the townships. New homes were built on nearly every road in the township. Gasoline stations cropped up at Rts. 76 and 3, campgrounds came into being, a large auto dealership was built, a golf course in the southeast section of the township, an airport ad housing complex was built at Acme. Land was annexed into the village of Seville to allow room for more industry; Muehler Packing Co., now Ohio Wholesale, and Jaffy Shoe Co. were soon on the move and employing more and more people. More land was annexed to the village to make room for a housing complex on the Southeast corner of Rts. 3 and 97 (old 224).  Another annexation on the North side of 97, just east of Rt. 3 brought a small shopping plaza and grocery-drug store to the village along with another housing complex.  With the annexations, expansions, and population growth in the village, growing pains were bound to come. A large problem is facing the village at this time. The sewage system, the EPA says, in inadequate to handle the added amounts of sewage and run-off, and needs to be updated again. This is foremost in the minds of the Board of Public Affairs of Seville, and Village Council, who are trying to resolve the situation.  With the mechanization of farming coming into the farming picture in the early 1950\u2019s, farmers were able to till more acreage and increase production. Larger horsepower tractors with equipment to match, self-propelled combines and harvesters, automatic balers, silo unloaders, automated feeding systems, bulk milk cooling and storage tanks, milking parlors, all played a great roll in the unsurpassed achievement of farming the farmers of Guilford Township are doing today.  With the smaller sized farm staying at around 90 acres and 25 milk cows, and ranging up to one of the largest dairies in the State of Ohio with 500 milk cows and 400 head coming up as replacements, and farming approximately 1,610 acres, in and out of the township, this operation is a family enterprise, one of many that has sprung up in the county. Guilford farmers can hold their heads high and not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to fulfilling the task of doing their share in the largest industry in the country; agriculture.  Not only do we have fine farms and farmers, we can also boast one of the largest maple syrup making operations in the county, if not the state. The Maple Valley Farms of Guilford Township is a family affair and is now in the fourth generation with the fifth generation just in the tasting stage, but coming on strong.  Then too, we must not forget the large watershed control dam of Hubbard Cheek \u2013 Hubbard Valley Park. This project controls the waters from the North central part of the township and keeps the waters at a more controlled level when meeting the Chippewa Creek waters at the Village of Seville, thus keeping the village less apt to flood as was known to occur in the past.  With progress and changes happening nearly every few months, Guilford Township keeps moving forward in making it a great place to live.
