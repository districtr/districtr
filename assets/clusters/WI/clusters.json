In addition there are many parks along with the Bark River Nature Reserve.  The parks in this COI are used frequently.  There are Concerts in the Park at the Rotary River Front Park.  This COI also has a large number of highly  established churchs that are well attended.  Many of the churches were establishes in the early settlement time for Jefferson.  Many people in the Jefferson COI work in county government, work in the surrounding towns or work right in Jefferson.  Unlike other towns closer to the I94 system, fewer people commute to more urban areas like Milwaukee or Madison.  Jefferson does have an industrial park.   One of the larger employers  in the area  is Nestle Purina.  St Colletta is also a very famous establishment nationally and large employer, serving  individuals.   A super Walmart was recently built on the edge of town in the City of Jefferson and attracts people from the surrondng areas.  The Jefferson COunty Fair Grounds holds many large events that draw hundreds of people of all ages over the course of the year, typically on weekends in the spring, summer and fall.

This map focuses on a tiny, unincorporated village in Wisconsin known by US Census as Helenville. It is intended to be a portion of a larger map that represents the Rock River Basin Watershed in Wisconsin. For any small, remote, rural village, travel to available community business and professional services is of major concern. At a minimum, these include groceries, healthcare, employment and education. For remote villagers, travel to these resources is one definition of what defines their community and creates a region of common concerns. Consequently, this initial draft focuses on identifying the surrounding communities supplying community services to Helenville. The \"important places\" represented by dots outside of Helenville are focused on grocery, healthcare, employment, education and Town and County government location.   Politically, Helenville is located in Ward 1 of the Town of Jefferson, Jefferson County, Wisconsin. To the west is Ward 2 of the Town of Jefferson. To the North is the Town of Farmington. East is the Town of Sullivan. South is the Town of Hebron. Public school education is located west, in the City of Jefferson. Geographically, Helenville is located in the east Rock River Basin. The closest business and professional services for Helenville are found in three Rock River communities to the west, Johnson Creek, Jefferson and Fort Atkinson.  Due to HERC membership, secondary and tertiary healthcare is largely west to Madison or occasionally east to Milwaukee. Commuting for work may reach west to Madison, north to Watertown, east to Milwaukee, south to Whitewater or southwest to Janesville. Political representation for tiny Helenville and Surrounds is split into two State Assembly Districts and two State Senate Districts, all of which project into Jefferson County from wealthier, highly-developed counties to the east.

The Watertown COI was first settled by German immigrants in the mid 1800s.  The City of Watertown now has a population of more than 24,000 residents.  Watertown and the surrounding areas are heavily influenced by strong religious ties, with numerous churches and church schools.     Watertown has had a strong commitment to education and is nationally known for having the site of the first kindergarten.  The Watertown Community of Interest (COI) is home to Luther Prep High School, Maranatha University, eleven private and parochial schools, and seven public schools in the Watertown Unified School District serving students in grades pre-kindergarten through high school.  Maranatha University over the years has made it their mission to become more involved in the Watertown community.  For example, they will often make their facilities available for community meetings and they also offer music lessons to students from Watertown and neighboring communities.  The Lutheran Prep High School has also had a strong influence in the Watertown COI.   Watertown has had a strong reputation for excellent schools for a long time and this has been a significant factor in broadening the boundaries of the Watertown COI.  Children from many outlying rural areas feed into the Watertown Unified School District.  For example, the Watertown School District reaches to the western edges of Ixonia, the southern edges of Clyman, the western edges of Ashippin, and the northern edges of Sullivan, even though these towns are all part of other school districts.  Lebanon is the only town today that has a school system that eventually feeds into the Watertown Unified School District.  Years ago, families in the rural farming regions around Watertown would strive to make their land contiguous with land that was part of the Watertown school district, which would then allow their children to attend the Watertown schools.  As a result, the Watertown School District includes very large rural areas that stretch to the edges of these other communities.  This has been a significant factor in enlarging the Watertown COI over time.  Another factor contributing to the breadth and strength of the Watertown COI is the abundance of natural resources.  There are numerous parks and wildlife areas in the Watertown COI.  The Rock River is one of the central resources that bends and winds its way around and through the Watertown area, giving rise to many parks and recreational areas.  This has led to the branding \u2018A River Runs Through It\u2019 for the Watertown area.  The meandering of the Rock River has also led to some actual islands within the Watertown area that are rather unique.  The Riverside and Brandt Quirk Parks in particular are today very popular for community gatherings and festivals.    In recent years Watertown has changed in ways that are impacting the identity of the community. Steady growth in Watertown is averaging nearly 1.5% per year, with increasing numbers of students enrolling in the Watertown schools.  As a result, a number of sub-divisions have been developed in recent years, particularly around the western portions of Watertown.  These western parts of Watertown continue to be active areas for housing development, especially near the intersections of Hwy 26 and Hwy 19.  State Hwys 19, 16 and 26 provide quick access to neighboring communities and to the I94 system.  This has encouraged steady residential and industrial growth in the Watertown COI.  Today there is a mixture of citizens who either work right in the Watertown COI or commute to surrounding cities and towns, including Janesville, Milwaukee and Madison.    Although the Watertown COI is unique in that it is part of both Dodge and Jefferson County, this has not created notable divisions in the community.  Given the growth and breadth of the Watertown COI, there are many people who come to the Watertown area for recreation, employment or other community interests from outlying communities like Lake Mills, Jefferson, Marshall, Reeseville, and Johnson Creek.  The Watertown YMCA, which is associated with the Oconomowoc YMCA, is a good example of a strong nonprofit organization that draws children and adults from surrounding areas who participate in numerous recreational and community activities.

The district is made up of the old downtown of Waterloo, including the 1874 Italianate-styled Muebus & Fiebeger's Double Block, the 1885 Brandner dry goods store, the 1893 Queen Anne-styled Doering Block,  the 1896 Becken's Saloon, the 1897 Failinger general store, the 1923 Neoclassical Community Hall, the 1924 Colonial Revival-ish Stoke Brothers Auto Filling Station, and the 1938 Arte Moderne Mode Theater.  During its eastward journey, the Menasha River forms two large ox-bow bends that are located near the center of what is now the downtown of the city of Waterloo. The smaller and the easternmost of these bends is bisected from north to south by Monroe Street and from east to west by Madison Street. These streets have historically been the principal routes into and out of the city (Monroe Street becoming State Highway 89 and Madison Street State Highway 19 outside of Waterloo). The gradual concentration of commercial activity around their point of intersection resulted in their becoming the commercial center of Waterloo.. The city is the headquarters for Trek Bicycle Corporation and Van Holten Pickles.  Waterloo was formerly the headquarters of Perry Printing, later called Perry-Judd.    Given its poximity to Hwy 19 and I94 that reach conect to other neighboring  communities quite easily, citizens of Waterloo do often travel to other neighboring communties for employment and shopping like Marshal, Watertown, Sun Praire, Madison and other towns along I94.  Some principal annual events in the Waterloo COI include: \u2022\tWiener and Kraut Day \u2022\tFireman's Park 4 July \u2022\tChristmas Holiday Parade  Waterloo has an abundance of natural resources, including many parks and waterways.

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers four communities in which people of Hmong and Lao ethnic descent live in Milwaukee County.  The first Hmong and Lao refugee families settled in Milwaukee after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into two main neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation SE Asian families have since moved from the inner-city neighborhoods to northwest Milwaukee County.  More recently, refugees from Southeast Asia, particularly from Burma/Myanmar, have settled in these older Milwaukee neighborhoods.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.  The following individuals were interviewed by Lorna Young for this \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" map:  Channy Rasavong (ULED, Lao Community Center of Wisconsin),  Mayhoua and Zongcheng Moua (Milwaukee Consortium for Hmong Health and Moua Consulting Group),  Martha L.

The housing stock is mostly small working class duplexes and single family structures built in the early 1900s. Larger, fancier homes are located in the southern end. The original residents were of Polish and German descent followed by African and Hispanic Americans. Proximity to UW-Milwaukee has brought a vibrant youth and artistic flair to the eastern part of this community.    This cultural and racial diversity creates a special and unique place for people to live, work and socialize together. Because of this diversity our community forms a strong multicultural and generational voice that must remain whole within the new election districts being drawn this year.

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers four communities in which people of Hmong and Lao ethnic descent live in Milwaukee County.  The first Hmong and Lao refugee families settled in Milwaukee after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into two main neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation SE Asian families have since moved from the inner-city neighborhoods to northwest Milwaukee County.  More recently, refugees from Southeast Asia, particularly from Burma/Myanmar, have settled in these older Milwaukee neighborhoods.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.  The following individuals were interviewed by Lorna Young for this \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" map:  Channy Rasavong (ULED, Lao Community Center of Wisconsin),  Mayhoua and Zongcheng Moua (Milwaukee Consortium for Hmong Health and Moua Consulting Group),  Martha L.

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers four communities in which people of Hmong and Lao ethnic descent live in Milwaukee County.  The first Hmong and Lao refugee families settled in Milwaukee after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into two main neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation SE Asian families have since moved from the inner-city neighborhoods to northwest Milwaukee County.  More recently, refugees from Southeast Asia, particularly from Burma/Myanmar, have settled in these older Milwaukee neighborhoods.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.  The following individuals were interviewed by Lorna Young for this \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" map:  Channy Rasavong (ULED, Lao Community Center of Wisconsin),  Mayhoua and Zongcheng Moua (Milwaukee Consortium for Hmong Health and Moua Consulting Group),  Martha L.

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled \"AAPI: Filipinx COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers seven communities in which immigrants from the Philippines and subsequent generations live in the Milwaukee area.  The early immigrants were students in the early 1900s; then four waves of immigrants thereafter, of professionals (military, healthcare workers), in the 1960s-1970s; after the 1965 immigration act, the majority were able to immigrate as professionals or military. \"Brain drain\" in the 1970s with martial law in the Philippines due to Marcos. Many of Filipinos who immigrated in the 1960\u2019s came due to shortage of healthcare workers in WI.  The younger millennials of Filipino descent who are either children of earlier immigrants or are recent immigrants might live in the same communities as their relatives or live in neighborhoods with others in the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

The younger millennials tend to ally themselves with other young AAPI and other millennials who live in this area, and are more likely to be \u201cprogressive\u201d in their political views.  Liberal millennial Filipina women are concerned with women\u2019s healthcare particularly pro-choice; diversity/inclusion; want to make sure that organizations that claim to be more equitable are keeping their word (employers, restaurants, retail stores, in their hiring practices and advertising), particularly in light of George Floyd\u2019s death.

This map is titled \"AAPI: Filipinx COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers seven communities in which immigrants from the Philippines and subsequent generations live in the Milwaukee area.  The early immigrants were students in the early 1900s; then four waves of immigrants thereafter, of professionals (military, healthcare workers), in the 1960s-1970s; after the 1965 immigration act, the majority were able to immigrate as professionals or military. \"Brain drain\" in the 1970s with martial law in the Philippines due to Marcos. Many of Filipinos who immigrated in the 1960\u2019s came due to shortage of healthcare workers in WI.  The younger millennials of Filipino descent who are either children of earlier immigrants or are recent immigrants might live in the same communities as their relatives or live in neighborhoods with others in the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled \"AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI\" and covers four communities in which people of Hmong and Lao ethnic descent live in Milwaukee County.  The first Hmong and Lao refugee families settled in Milwaukee after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into two main neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation SE Asian families have since moved from the inner-city neighborhoods to northwest Milwaukee County.  More recently, refugees from Southeast Asia, particularly from Burma/Myanmar, have settled in these older Milwaukee neighborhoods.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

This map is titled \"AAPI: Burmese/Rohingya COI in Milwaukee, WI \" and covers two communities in which Rohingya refugees live in Milwaukee County. The total Rohingya community in Milwaukee estimated at 2,300-4,000 as of June 2021, with 90% having arrived between 2011-2017 as refugees from Burma/Myanmar.

While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information.

This map is titled \"AAPI: Hmong COI in Eau Claire, WI\" and covers six communities in which people of Hmong ethnic descent live in the Eau Claire area. The first Hmong refugee families settled in Eau Claire after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into several downtown neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation Hmong families or subsequent generations have since moved from the downtown neighborhoods to \u201cnewer\u201d communities to the North, East, South, and West of the \u201colder\u201d communities.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for \u201cAsians\u201d in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the \u201cqualitative\u201d understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the \u201cquantitative\u201d ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the \u201cAsian\u201d designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this \u201cAsian\u201d designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR \u201cAsian\u201d population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for \u201cAsians\u201d may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

Rather the nation owns land in 14 WI counties:  Adams, Clark, Crawford, Dane, Eau Claire, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Marathon, Monroe, Sauk, Shawano, Vernon and Wood.  This is a result of the failed attempts from 1832-1874 to ethnically cleanse the Ho-Chunk out of WI and IL to lands West. But the Ho-Chunk continuously returned here. Finally they creatively used  the 1862 Homestead Act to purchase land in their ancestral home here. This determined resilience finally brought the Indian Homestead Act of 1875.

Several of our many cold water streams boast Class 1 trout fishing. They include four DNR Creek Fisheries being studied as Exceptional Water Resources. Our county has seven State Natural Areas adding up to almost 4,000 acres of bio-diverse land that give us a glimpse into what our lands were like 200 years ago.   But can we preserve our amazing ecology?  Continuing together, yes!  There is a long tradition here of preventing erosion on our hillsides by strip farming. And family farmers here seem to lead the state in no-till and cover crop techniques. We hold farmers in our hearts during these difficult times.     Recent studies have shown high levels of nitrates in some private wells. Our Karst terrain can be exacerbating this problem with its shallow soil, fissures, cracks and caves. There is high potential for surface water runoff to bypass natural soil filtration bringing contaminants into drinking water.     Adding more deep intrusions into this terrain could increase water contamination. Two kinds of major intrusions are being proposed in Iowa County. And we, countywide, would pay the price.   1) After extensive citizen objections, our Iowa County Board registered its opposition to ATC utilities creating a new high-voltage transmission line that would disrupt our fragile land. Even Public Service Commission (PSC) staff and many conservation groups had recommended local renewable power which would avoid damaging natural areas. Iowa County joined many ratepayers to appeal the PSC decision. Conflicts of interest by some PSC members are part of appeals, which are still pending.  2) A multinational is taking advantage of WI\u2019s lax corporate regulations and approaching individual landowners to sign leases to spread 172 utility scale wind turbines around Cobb, Linden, Mineral Point, Dodgeville, Mifflin, Waldwick, Eden, Highland and Moscow. Foundations for these 650\u2019 tall turbines would be set deep into the unstable Karst terrain. This \u201cUplands\u201d wind project is dependent on the proposed ATC transmission line still in the appeals process. After meeting with residents in opposition, Iowa County legislators have called on Governor Evers to hold a hearing on the subject.   Many of us engage in hands on conservation work. We volunteer in groups like Friends of the Ridgeway State Natural Area, Friends of the Military Ridge State Trail,  the Driftless Area Land Conservancy, Bethel Horizons Camp, Prairie Enthusiasts, Kiwanis\u2019 Clean Boats/Clean Lakes and more.   Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville.

Upland Hills Health is our community hospital with a volunteer board of directors representing our local areas. It is a critical access hospital that also has seven family medicine clinic locations and a Nursing and Rehab Center.  Other exercise and wellness opportunities are posted with the county. A Meals on Wheels program is active with volunteer support.  Thirty one congregations are listed at https://www.iowacounty.org/religious-institutions.

A large number of congregations, PTO's and civic groups take turns bringing the various foods for the particular menu and sit down and eat with those who come for the meal.   Farmers Markets are held on Saturdays in Dodgeville, Saturdays in Mineral Point and Sundays in Ridgeway.  We cherish our grocery stores and their cheese and meat counters in Dodgeville, Mineral Point and Hollandale. The Uplands Garden Club meets in Dodgeville and on sites of member gradens. There is a new Garden and Nature Club in Ridgeway.

A large number of congregations, PTO's and civic groups take turns bringing the various foods for the particular menu and sit down and eat with those who come for the meal.   Farmers Markets are held on Saturdays in Dodgeville, Saturdays in Mineral Point and Sundays in Ridgeway.  We cherish our grocery stores and their cheese and meat counters in Dodgeville, Mineral Point and Hollandale. The Uplands Garden Club meets in Dodgeville and on sites of member gardens. There is a new Garden and Nature Club in Ridgeway. Besides, native plants at the village signs, this club is doing amazing, innovative work of enhancing native species around a fairly new retention pond. This helps habitat for beneficial wildlife. Permanent benches are placed for contemplation. The historic venues that we visit and show visitors include Taliesin, House on the Rock, Hyde\u2019s Mill, Folklore Village folk art, American Players Theater, Shake Rag Alley art education center, Pendarvis Historic Site, Botham Vineyards & Winery, Spurgeon Vineyards & Winery, Nick Engelbert\u2019s Grandview, the White Church Theatre Project and the Mineral Point Opera House, among others. Finally, we understand that even as a county, we are not an island onto ourselves. Many of us communicate through broader groups like the WI League of Municipalities, UW Extension, the Regional Plan Commission, the Fair Maps Coalition and Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice.

Yes, Iowa County naturally connects us as a community of interest by its geology. And we are deeply connected by the way we care for the earth and  for each other ...

Our geology connects us as a community. We are deeply connected by the way we care for this land and for each other. Bordered on the North by the Wisconsin River, Iowa County\u2019s Driftless Area's river valleys, towering rock outcrops and rolling hills foster special care and local pride. Several of our many cold water streams boast Class 1 trout fishing. They include four DNR Creek Fisheries being studied as Exceptional Water Resources. Our county has SEVEN State Natural Areas adding up to almost 4,000 acres of bio-diverse land, scattered throughout the County, that give us a glimpse into what our lands were like 200 years ago. But can we preserve our amazing ecology? Continuing together, yes! There is a long tradition here of preventing erosion on our hillsides by strip farming. And family farmers here seem to lead the state in no-till and cover crop techniques. We hold farmers in our hearts during these difficult times. Recent studies have shown high levels of nitrates in some private wells. Our Karst terrain can be exacerbating this problem with its shallow soil, fissures, cracks and caves. There is high potential for surface water runoff to bypass natural soil filtration bringing contaminants into drinking water. Adding more deep intrusions into this terrain could increase water contamination. Two kinds of major intrusions are being proposed in Iowa County. And we, countywide, would pay the price. 1) After extensive citizen objections, our Iowa County Board registered its opposition to ATC utilities creating a new high-voltage transmission line that would disrupt our fragile land. Even Public Service Commission (PSC) staff and many conservation groups had recommended local renewable power which would avoid damaging natural areas. Iowa County joined many ratepayers to appeal the PSC decision. Conflicts of interest by some PSC members are part of appeals, which are still pending. 2) A multinational is taking advantage of WI\u2019s lax corporate regulations and approaching individual landowners to sign leases to spread 172 utility scale wind turbines around Cobb, Linden, Mineral Point, Dodgeville, Mifflin, Waldwick, Eden, Highland and Moscow. Foundations for these 650\u2019 tall turbines would be set deep into the unstable Karst terrain. This \u201cUplands\u201d wind project is dependent on the proposed ATC transmission line still in the appeals process. After meeting with residents in opposition, Iowa County legislators have called on Governor Evers to hold a hearing on the subject. Many of us engage in hands on conservation work. We volunteer in groups like Friends of the Ridgeway State Natural Area, Friends of the Military Ridge State Trail, the Driftless Area Land Conservancy, Bethel Horizons Camp, Prairie Enthusiasts, Kiwanis\u2019 Clean Boats/Clean Lakes and more. Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville. Mining stopped decades ago, but traditions of carrying Cornish pasties continues in many fundraisers. Many hundreds of mining sites are recorded. Due to the makeup of our land, quarrying for stone foundations and for road surfaces is longstanding and still serves a wide area. The Iowa County courthouse, the oldest, active courthouse in the state of Wisconsin, was built of native limestone by skilled Cornish masons. It is one of many handsome buildings in downtown Dodgeville that date to the 1800s. Family farming, flour mills, cheese factories, taverns and apple orchards sprang up easily. We still enjoy these and crafts such as carpentry, architecture, fiber arts, pottery, painting, making music and drama. We also gather for biking, hiking, music, dance, arts. We have a common ethic of helping each other out. All eleven Fire Departments of Iowa County are volunteer and they work with each other. We support a joint volunteer Iowa County Technical Rescue Team to assist local EMTs, police and fire departments in more difficult rescues.  We push for EMT service to be considered essential services to qualify for more state assistance.  Iowa County has eight public libraries who work together for library access for all residents. Their outreach includes many additional Pop-up libraries. The Dodgeville Public Library is currently training volunteers to provide hours of library service within the Ridgeway Community Center.  The Dodgeville Chronicle and The Democrat Tribune newspapers help us hear from each other. Upland Hills Health is our community hospital with a volunteer board of directors representing our local areas. It is a critical access hospital that also has seven family medicine clinic locations and a Nursing and Rehab Center. Other exercise and wellness opportunities are posted with the county.

The main reason we moved from Milwaukee to Grafton was because of education. It was in the late 60s and Milwaukee was talking about busing. We owned a home in Milwaukee within walking distance to schools. We bought a lot in Grafton so our children could continue to walk to school. I would like everyone, everywhere, to have access to quality education and strongly believe in quality neighborhood schools everywhere, especially in Milwaukee.  My Grafton library is important to me, and its extension to other municipal libraries through the Monarch Library System, which gives me broad access to written information for my life long learning.  I am also concerned about my local environment. I recreate along the Milwaukee River in Bratt Woods, and along Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline from Lion\u2019s Den Gorge to Port Washington\u2019s beaches. I am concerned about water quality and pollution run off in these areas as well as bluff erosion along the lake.
