The green area in Macomb County (plus Harper Woods) now has an African American VAP of over 31%, which is a 14% increase over 2010, or nearly double.  The Michigan Ave area west of Dearborn now has an African-American VAP of over 38%. Pontiac's African-American VAP is relatively unchanged at just under 50% but it remains one of the most integrated communities in Michigan.

That helped us support each other in the difficult years that followed.  Our neighborhood went through a lot. When unemployment soared  and Detroit housing values plunged in the 1980s, city taxes remained high and few people knew about the Hardship exemption that could have helped save their homes. Meanwhile, banks were promoting mortgages they knew people didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t afford. That double whammy created a wave of foreclosures and vacated homes. But through mutual support we made it through those hard years so well that we were later voted \u2013 twice! -- the best neighborhood in Detroit. The communities on either side of EEV, Morningside and Cornerstone, also faced daunting problems of depopulation and devasted housing stock. So they also organized into associations of mutual support and camaraderie, with multi-racial participation.  A few years ago our three neighborhoods founded the MECCA Development Corporation to help us work together to revitalize the area and offer resources to young people. (This became especially important after the City closed the Recreation Center that used to be next to the High School.) One of our main shared projects is to redevelop the distressed East Warren commercial strip that runs through all three neighborhoods.  At a time when local movie theaters vanished from neighborhoods en masse, a determined group of citizens organized to save the abandoned Alger Theater on the border between East English Village and Morningside. It is being revitalized and sponsors art and other events.  With help from the city and other resources, we founded the East Warren Development Corp that is spurring small businesses to locate in the area and now runs a farmers market on Warren. The beautiful Balduck Park that\u2019s within Cornerstone also has been revamped with support from the UAW and other funders, and residents have organized farms and community gardens. We have a good rapport with the 5th police Precinct that serves our neighborhood. We all share a wonderful public library on Warren. And one of the most unique and beloved Detroit entertainment venues, Cadieux Caf\u00e9, on the Cornerstone side of Cadieux, attracts patrons from all over the Metro area. We also have Ascension St. John Hospital and several fitness centers, including LA Fitness. Nonetheless, our neighborhoods were very poorly served by past redistricting. For no apparent reason, all three neighborhoods were split into two separate State House districts. That made it harder for us to work together to bring attention to our needs. And the absurdly gerrymandered 14th Congressional District left us represented by a Congressperson who lives far away in Southield and had the impossible task of serving pieces of dozens of disparate communities that stretched all the way to Pontiac.

This plan was developed via strong engagement with all three communities in an effort to design a beautiful, walkable, functioning business environment that would be supported by the residents. After months of meetings (via ZOOM during Covid19), the final plans were presented by Mayor Mike Duggan on May 26.  Residents voted and overwhelmingly (72-2) chose a plan with construction slated for 2022.  Even the Mayor commented that he\u2019d never seen such a congenial group come to such a conclusive decision so quickly with minimal debate and without negative comments.  This was due to the fact that representatives from all three neighborhoods had been involved from the beginning and kept the residents informed throughout the process of the various options, thus answering many of their question and addressing concerns prior to the final presentation.   We are three neighborhoods united together except when it comes time to vote \u2013 as all three communities have been split into two State House districts.  The gerrymandering negatively impacted our Congressional voice as well since it encompasses an area of 40+ miles from Detroit to Pontiac.  We feel strongly that our three neighborhoods ~ a strong voting bloc that turns out for Local, State and Federal elections ~ should not be split up when it comes time to redistrict the State of Michigan.  In addition, I would like to see the Detroit Jefferson/Chalmers neighborhood (which abuts Morningside to the south) as well as Grosse Pointe Park and Grosse Pointe City also included in our new District. These cities share our common quality of life concerns and are working together to achieve improvement beyond the borders.  The Mack Avenue Improvement Project is just one example of the residents of the various neighborhoods working in conjunction with City administration and planning departments to design a new plan for Mack Avenue.  Residents of Detroit and the Grosse Pointes strongly support the local businesses and restaurants in each of the various communities.  Residents on both sides of the Detroit/Grosse Pointe borders are working together to find common ground to better ensure that each city does not remain its own little island. Teamwork is dreamwork as the saying goes.  In conclusion, my recommendation would be to keep the entire Detroit communities of East English Village, Morningside, Cornerstone and Jefferson/Chalmers along with Grosse Pointe Park and Grosse Pointe City as part of one of the newly-designed districts.  Thank you for this opportunity to submit our ideas and reviewing and considering our recommendations.

Having lived in downtown Detroit for 16 years, I was excited about all the beautiful, affordable, and well-built brick homes in East English Village.  Many of these homes with their unique characteristics were designed by the original owners.  East English Village was also home to many Police Officers, Firefighters, Doctors, Lawyers, and other professionals, and with a diverse population.  I viewed many homes in East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside.  I decided to purchase a brick home on Harvard in East English Village.  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside have all gone through some very hard times.  Housing values dropped in the 1980s, but the city taxes remained high, and unemployment grew rapidly.  All this making it difficult for many long-time residents to stay afloat and be able to stay in their homes.  Cornerstone and Morningside suffered greatly with many foreclosures.  A large number of homes became vacant to be left neglected and blighted.  East English Village was able to pull together and was able to fair better.  East English Village has recently been voted 2 years in succession as the best neighborhood in Detroit.  East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside all have organized Block Clubs that provide valuable information to their residents.  It is all helping to pull us together, stabilizing efforts to improve our neighborhoods.  We all have monthly meetings and elected officials.  East English Village and Morningside have newsletters to help reach those who cannot get to meetings..  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside Communities share many amenities.  The Historic Alger Theater is one of only two unchanged neighborhood theaters still standing in Detroit.  It is currently being revitalized by a determined group of our citizens to get it fully operable once again.  The Cadieux Cafe offers live entertainment, attracting patrons from all around.  Jefferson Branch of the Detroit Public Library has been updated and is available for us to use.  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside founded the MECCA Development Corporation which helps us work together to provide resources to our young people.  A key issue because our children are our future.  There is also Balduck Park getting some updating.  We also have some beautiful Community Gardens.  With help from the City, East Warren/Cadieux Development Plan, and our three neighborhoods working together a plan has been developed to revitalize the East Warren commercial business district.  We now have a Farmer's Market on the East Warren Corridor.  Our 5th Police Precinct encompasses East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside Neighborhoods.  They work closely with us to provide community support.  We have Neighborhood Police Officers (NPOs) who cover our areas.  They work primarily with issues and problems specific to their certain Scout Car Area.  They also attend their areas monthly Block Club Meeting with updates and answer questions that citizens may have.  Our Commander, Commander Ewing, holds Procedural Justice and Restorative Practice Community Meetings as well as Domestic Violence Summit Meetings to strengthen relationships between the police and the citizens.  There is a monthly 5th Precinct Community Meeting in which people from East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside attend.  The Commander, the Captain, NPO's and other Officers are usually in attendance with any updates and other helpful information for us as well as answering questions from us.  We also have MEC Neighborhood Patrol that is an organized, dedicated group of people who patrol the streets watching for unusual or criminal activity in the 5th Precinct.  We have police radios to use while on patrol that put in touch with the precinct when necessary.  Keeps our neighborhoods a little safer, and also adds extra eyes for our officers.  We also have many ties with the surrounding cities of Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe, Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Farms and Hamtramck, as well as other eastside neighborhoods and  downtown Detroit. Just as I did, many of our neighbors moved here from downtown. We attend each other's cutltural events and shop in all those neighborhoods. Many children from our neighborhood atend St. Clair School in Grosse Point Park.  It is important to me to keep our neighborhoods solid and stable.  There is definitely a need for good schools for our children.  More accessible and reliable transportation is also key to our stability.  Our residents need fresh food markets and grocery stores.  Good Police Protection, which I feel we have a good relationship there already.  Always room to make it better.  In the past our neighborhoods have not been properly served.  Our neighborhoods have been split between 2 separate State House Districts which has made it difficult for us to work together on our like and shared needs.  It is relevant that we need compact districts which can unite not divide us.  This would also make it easier for our representative to participate and better understand our needs.

I am asking that we include parts of Detroit in Hamtramck\u2019s district.   One example of why the commission should include parts of Detroit with Hamtramck is the ability to service immigrant communities with better language access materials in native languages. There is a large demand for civic, health, and educational reading material in native languages, given the recent health crisis of the covid-19 pandemic, it has highlighted and uncovered the need for more language access throughout Hamtramck and parts of Detroit.

This map and narrative of the Hamtramck-Banglatown Community of Interest was built out by Global Detroit, a community and economic development organization, with community feedback.   Since the arrival of German farmers in the 1800s, Hamtramck has been known as a magnet for immigrant groups. The Polish autoworkers of the 1900s are perhaps the most well known group, but today the predominant groups are Bangladeshi and Yemeni. While limitations of ethnic representation in Census data hinder the accuracy of population numbers, we estimate that of the current Hamtramck population of roughly 22,000, there are a little over 9,000 foreign born residents. Of that number, roughly 3,800 are from Bangladesh and 3,650 from Yemen. This does not reflect second and third generation residents of Bangladeshi and Yemeni heritage and we also know that with expansion into Detroit, the numbers of the whole community are much larger. There is also still a significant number of Eastern European residents and a little over a third of the community\u2019s residents are Black. This has created a distinct multiethnic, multilinguistic, multicultural community as evidenced by the diversity of restaurants, grocery stores, and other small businesses that line Hamtramck\u2019s streets.   While residents of this community contribute economically to the wider region by staffing manufacturing, hospitality, and other frontline jobs, a large portion are living below the poverty line and rely on income-qualified programming and assistance. Simultaneously, this Community of Interest has a significantly larger density of locally owned businesses than the Detroit area as a whole.   Environmentally, residents of this Community of Interest face public health challenges due to the industrial use of land in the South and East of the community. This industrial land use has created a Sacrifice Zone which has led to chronic respiratory diseases, lower birth weights, and higher mortality rates both in general and throughout the COVID crisis, than in the rest of Michigan. Submission c780 builds out the environmental case for this Community of Interest more thoroughly.   While new residents are drawn to this area because of the cultural communities established in Hamtramck, housing stock is dwindling in quantity, quality, and affordability which has necessitated that the community branch out into local Detroit neighborhoods which have more vacant properties. The neighborhood of Banglatown, so named for the large concentration of Bangladeshi residents, is an example of this. It straddles the Hamtramck/Detroit border to the north. The Bangladeshi community will continue to grow northwards and likely form a corridor between Hamtramck and Warren where a significant number of Bangladeshis currently reside over the next decade or so. Yemeni residents are mostly expanding into Detroit to the South East towards 94 and Gratiot, but are also moving in smaller numbers into East Davison Village which borders Banglatown.   The community is also expanding westward towards John R, drawn by businesses and organizations that they rely on - the Wayne State University Islamic Center of Detroit on Cass, the all-girls Detroit International Academy which has a significant number of Bangladeshi students, and the Secretary of State office on Grand Boulevard - as well as new projects in development off Brush, Holbrook, and Owen.    This trend of outward expansion will continue. Since the Commission is tasked with being mindful of city, township, and county boundaries when drawing district maps, it is vital to emphasize that using the Hamtramck/Detroit borders as guides for district boundaries, as several proposed maps suggest, would sever this Community of Interest and be incredibly harmful to its political power.

Commissioner Eid seemed to claim that because people think of it as one community of interest, that it can be divided in a way that makes two Lansing/Urban - dominated state senate districts.  I listened to commissioner Eid\u2019s rationale for splitting the City of Lansing and combining urban and rural areas and I request clarification.  He stated that it was based on comments 5, 13, 20, 21, 22, 34, and 54.  I presume this was from the Lansing public hearing on May 27.  Can commissioner Eid please clarify?  I ask because none of those public comments asked that the City of Lansing be split.  Comment 5 appeared to suggest that the area is too fractured in unusual ways and a more consistent standard reflective of the community should be used.  Comment 13 (from the transcript) referred to not wanting to split up her community, which she referred to as being Democrats (\u201cwe are Democrats\u201d).  She was apparently part of the hispanic community in the Lansing area, but neither she nor commissioner Eid identified where that community was located.  Commenters 20-22 all complained about the Tri-Counties being split-up at the congressional level, but made no mention of the state senate.  In fact, it is impossible to fit all three counties in the same state senate district.  Commenter 34 also focused on not splitting up the counties at the congressional level.  Commenter 54 specifically said that Lansing and Ann Arbor should be combined.  Now, it is possible that I misunderstood commissioner Eid today.  And if so,  I request that he clarify.  Because without such clarification, it appears that the goal is to gerrymander.

As a lifelong resident of Macomb County I have never even visited Bad Axe, Sandusky, Bay City or Saginaw, nor do I know anyone who commutes daily between this region and Macomb County.  The \"thumb\" region of the state seems , therefore, to be significantly distinct from Macomb County.  It, therefore, makes no sense to me that northern Macomb County is included in the same congressional district as the thumb, while southern Macomb county is in a separate district that is together with parts of Oakland County.  Further, the shape of the congressional district for southern Macomb County is clearly Gerrymandered, as it is unusual in shape and that shape does not even follow an obvious transportation corridor.  Macomb County should, therefore, be part of a single congressional district.", "areaname": "Community 1", "areatext": "Macomb County", "districtr_id": "31178-1", "cluster_id": "c1672-1"}, {"title": "Common Interest & Balanced Districts", "description": "0", "areaname": "Lakeshore", "areatext": "Communities fronting Lake St. Clair", "districtr_id": "31440-1", "cluster_id": "c1725-1"}, {"title": "Southern Macomb County", "description": "This community is composed of the children and grandchildren of people who moved from Detroit to the suburbs in the mid-20th century.

Yesterday, there was a beach advisory for St. Clair shores due to elevated e-coli levels.  The beach wasn\u2019t shut down yesterday, but every year there are multiple shut-downs because there is too much human waste in the water.

I previously submitted this COI but I needed to add some really important detail before the portal closes, especially because lakeshore COIs have been unfairly called into question.  My COI is the Lake St. Clair Community of Interest.  So that no one is confused about the dividing line for our lakeshore community of interest, we are the suburbs that are EAST OF I-94 AND NORTH/EAST OF DETROIT and all cities/townships with frontage on Lake St. Clair.  This includes the 5 Grosse Pointes, St. Clair Shores, Harrison Township, Chesterfield, New Baltimore, Ira Twp., Algonac, and Clay Twp.  I have seen some people tie us in with the St. Clair River communities south of Port Huron and I agree with the logic of that, particularly when considering their shared use of our water resource from the upstream position.  There are a couple of big things that distinguish us from the communities in Southern Macomb County (West of I-94) and the East Side of Detroit.  First and foremost, we have NO INDUSTRIAL AREAS in our lakeshore COI.   In contrast, there are significant industrial corridors in the East Side of Detroit and Macomb County (in fact, it's what they're famous for).  This distinction is so important to understand because it puts our interests in direct conflict with our neighboring communities.  We understand that our lifestyle, our lakefront parks and amenities, and quality of life are all tied to proper stewardship of our lake.  To our South and our West are industrial corridors that have far different interests.  To help paint a better picture, there are two primary industrial corridors to consider.  Each of these corridors starts in the East Side of Detroit and continues north/northeast until reaching the Clinton River in Macomb County.  The first is the Groesbeck/Gratiot Corridor, which is a mix of aging commercial and mixed industrial between I-94 and Groesbeck.  It includes auto plants and some lighter industrial.  The second is the Mound/Van Dyke corridor, which starts at around the Detroit/Hamtramck plant and goes north all the way to the Clinton River in northern Sterling Heights.  This is a heavy industrial area.  More than industrial pollution, though, the most pressing need for our lakeshore is infrastructure to minimize human waste pollution (i.e., sewage discharges).  We have numerous beach closures every year because large cities in Macomb and Oakland Counties discharge sewage into our water.  It is worst during heavy rain storms because many communities have violated federal law by refusing to separate storm water and sewer systems, which results in overflows discharges.  I don\u2019t know what the right answer to all of this is, but I do know one thing . . . if you split us up and pair us with the industrial communities, our issues related to stewardship won\u2019t even be on the agenda.  We live a different lifestyle on the lakeshore. Many of us have busy city jobs/lives, but we choose to live where we can enjoy some balance with nature.

My name is John Daniele and I reside in the city of Grosse Pointe Woods located in the northern portion of Wayne County.  I first wish to express my sincere thanks to the Commissioners for volunteering to take on this very important - and what I am certain is an enormously challenging task. As you consider establishing the new district boundaries \u2013 I respectfully ask that you recognize the five Grosse Pointe municipalities of Grosse Pointe Woods; Grosse Pointe Farms; Grosse Pointe Shores; Grosse Pointe Park; and the City of Grosse Pointe and those communities north of the Grosse Pointes as my community of interest. I state this based on the fact that I not only live in Grosse Pointe Woods but also because I shop there; I socialize there; my neighbor\u2019s children are educated in the Grosse Pointe school system; I obtain my medical and dental services there; I dine out there; and I enjoy the library services there.  There also exists close cooperation between the fire and police agencies of the five Grosse Pointes. It is also critical for you to understand that my community of interest extends beyond the Grosse Pointes and into the lake communities north of the Grosse Pointes.  As evidence of that northern orientation it is important to mention that the city park of Grosse Pointe Woods lies within the city limits of St. Clair Shores \u2013 the city immediately north of Grosse Pointe Woods \u2013 and which lies within Macomb County.  It is also important to note that portions of Grosse Pointe Shores lie within Macomb County.  The Grosse Pointe School District includes significant portions of Harper Woods \u2013 a city to the north and west of the Grosse Pointes.   Those aspects of my life not lived out in the Grosse Pointes are lived out almost exclusively in the communities north of the Grosse Pointes.  I conduct additional shopping along the Harper Avenue shopping corridor between the Grosse Pointes and St. Clair Shores as well as the I 94 shopping corridor extending from the Grosse Pointes up through Clinton Township.  I personally worship in the city of Roseville \u2013 which is located to the north and west of the Grosse Pointes.  Numerous other neighbors worship in St Clair Shores.  I also enjoy the recreational opportunities offered by the \u201cNautical Mile\u201d located in St. Clair Shores. Therefore \u2013 as you establish the new district boundaries \u2013 I respectfully ask that you keep the Grosse Pointes whole and connected to the communities north of us.

The Palmer Park Apartment District had its initial gay heyday in the 1970s, when popular gay bars and restaurants opened nearby along McNichols and on Woodward Avenue. It was at Menjo\u2019s, which is still operating at 928 West McNichols, where dance instructor Christopher Flynn took his protegee Madonna to experience gay male nightlife for the first time.  Some buildings in the neighborhood boasted significant queer occupancy, and one, home to a number of female impersonators who performed at Bookie\u2019s Club 870 and other clubs, became known as the Drag Academy. Even after many white gay residents moved out to the suburbs, the more than sixty apartment buildings retained a strong gay cultural imprint, now predominantly reflecting an African American LGBTQ experience. The Park itself was a gathering place and cruising spot even in the 1950s, and served as the location for a day-long picnic held the day after Detroit\u2019s first Pride parade and rally in June 1972.

The agency services 70,000 individuals from disenfranchised communities\u2014primarily those representing the Arab American community\u2014on an annual basis. This on-the-ground experience has allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the needs and challenges facing this critically underrepresented community. The Arab American community that ACCESS serves most directly, in metropolitan Detroit, is one of the largest and most concentrated in the nation. But the community is also unique in its diversity, successes, and challenges. In metropolitan Detroit, we have many people with Lebanese, Iraqi, Yemeni, Syrian, Palestinian, and Egyptian ancestry. There are also smaller communities of people from Sudan, Morocco, and Algeria. The community is one of the oldest Arab American communities, with roots back to the 1890s, and receives more Arabic-speaking refugees and immigrants than almost any other metro area in the country.\u00a0  The U.S. Census counts people who hold Arab ancestry or other Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) origins within the \"White\" racial category. The truth is, Arab/MENA Americans have distinct issues, and experiences and national-level data on Arab/MENA Americans obscure regional variations, such as disadvantaged communities in the Metro Detroit area. Nationally, among Arabs living in the U.S., 75% live in multigenerational households, and 78% are U.S Citizens (Native-born & Naturalized). The Arab/MENA community, though lumped into the White racial category by the U.S. Census (following guidelines from the federal Office of Management and Budget), is quite distinct from the White population. The diverse Arab/MENA populations may trace their ancestry to different countries, speak different dialects or languages, practice different religions and fall into a broad range of socioeconomic categories. However, they have much more in common than any other ethnic or racial group. Using the best available data from the U.S. Census' American Community Survey (ACS), a report was created by ACCESS demonstrating that a picture of a unique community emerges as a result of disaggregating the Arab/MENA community from the White racial category. For instance, the socioeconomic characteristics by Ancestry and Location using ACS 5-Year Estimates (2010-2014, Weighted) indicate that 43% of the Arab/MENA community (ages 25-64) live in poverty 8.4% are unemployed. Moreover, the most recent issue of the ACCESS Health Journal, published in 2018, identifies: \"a growing body of research\" indicating \"that Arab Americans,\" particularly refugees, \"are subject to a host of stressors, including discrimination, lack of social support, and economic hardship that could detrimentally influence their mental health,\" but which are under-emphasized due current data.\u00a0  Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb: \u00a0 Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties are the three most populous counties in Michigan and comprise metro Detroit. These three counties also have the most significant Arab/MENA populations in the state and some of the most concentrated Arab and Iraqi Chaldean populations in the nation.\u00a0\u00a0  Dearborn and Dearborn Heights   Dearborn and Dearborn Heights have many commonalities, including history, culture, heritage, and ancestry. Many community members who live in Dearborn Heights, for example, either have family connections to Dearborn, work in the City of Dearborn. As one of our Volunteers, Sara stated on June 3rd, some even attend schools, not within their district. The current district maps divide Dearborn Heights and Dearborn in the middle. This divide is manifested in both the Senate and House maps for Dearborn Heights, further marginalizing the Arab/MENA community, impacting available resources, and making the right to vote for representatives that reflect their shared needs, concerns, & culture almost impossible. The Arab/MENA population in these areas has grown significantly over the last 20 years. Today the South end of Dearborn, where ACCESS' main branch is, has a high concentration of Arab/MENA residents (many of which are new immigrants & Refugees). Below are some data about the Arab population for 48120 zip code (which encompasses the south end and a wealthier section of Dearborn called Spring wells Park.\u00a0In 2000, according to the Census, 48120 was 49% Arab ancestry. According to 2015-2019 ACS, 48120 had 52% Arab. The growth of Arabs in the south end may not have changed much. However, it is the rest of Dearborn where one can see the change and growth:\u00a0  * In 1990, Dearborn was 15% Arab.\u00a0 * In 2000, Dearborn was 30% Arab.\u00a0 * In 2019, Dearborn was 47% Arab.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Drawing from the ACS Estimates (2015-2019), approximately 41.7% of the eastern side of Dearborn residents (Zip Code 48126) were foreign-born. 68.4% of those foreign-born were naturalized U.S. citizens, and an estimated 72.3% entered the country before 2010. The ACS data shows that 91.6% of foreign-born came from Asia, yet when asked about race only. The Arab/MENA population has tripled in 30 years and will continue to grow - albeit being undercounted.\u00a0\u00a0  Melvindale  Melvindale is part of the Arab/MENA community of Interest, isolated from the rest of the community in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights. ACCESS' youth and education program currently serves the community in Melvindale. It has Arab/MENA immigrant students, parents, and community members who share experiences with the rest of the MENA/Arab COI (Communities of Interest).   The Melvindale-Northern Allen Park Public Schools  The Melvindale-Northern Allen Park Public Schools is a suburb of the City of Detroit. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.76 square miles. The 2017 population (estimate) of the City of Melvindale was 10,322, with 24.7% of the population under the age of 18. Recent data indicates that the student population has increased in terms of cultural diversity in the past seven years. The student population consists of 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.6% Asian, 8.5% African American, 26.2% Hispanic, and 64.4% Caucasian (this figure does not accurately include the large Arab or Middle Eastern students).   ACCESS' 21st Century Community Learning Centers reflect the demographics in the 2020/2021 School Year:  The total number of enrolled students in cities between Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Redford, River Rouge, Melvindale, Allen Park, and Detroit is 940. Around 583 students were Arab (62%). In Melvindale (Zip Code 48122), the total number of students enrolled in the 21st-century community learning center was 151, of which 130 are Arab/MENA (86%). In Dearborn (Zip Code 48126), the total number of students enrolled in the same learning center was 291, where 280 are Arab/MENA (96%). In the South end of Dearborn (Zip Code 48120), the number of enrolled students is 95, of which 94 are Arab/MENA (99%).\u00a0\u00a0  The current Senate maps include Melvindale, but the House maps cut the community in the middle. The community in Melvindale has more commonalities and shared history and trauma with the cities of Dearborn and Dearborn Heights rather than Lincoln Park. The congressional map is not very different as it cuts Melvindale into another district away from their Arab/MENA community. Dearborn's congressional map places the city with cities like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, which have entirely different COIs with different socioeconomic backgrounds, experiences, educational levels, and needs. There is also part of west Detroit where a significant Arab/MENA population resides and whom ACCESS' serves. Since the Detroit metro area receives such a high number of refugees and recent immigrants from Arab countries, Arab Americans in Detroit are more likely to be impoverished and have a lower level of educational attainment than Arab Americans in other metro regions.\u00a0 \u00a0 The truth is, we may not be able to draw perfect lines and maps. Yet, we can ensure that communities of Interest, especially historically underrepresented communities, are not divided because of partisan lines. We urge the commission to make sure that our Community of Interest, the Arab/MENA community, which has contributed to the civic, political, and economic life of the Metro Detroit area, is connected.

St. Joseph encompassing the Northern parts of the County and Niles including the Southern region.  As the committee looks to draw new lines for our county, I would encourage you to maintain the North/South lines we currently have.   Because of our history, natural communities of interest have formed amongst this split.  For our citizens to get news, our papers follow the North/South split.  In the North, the Tri-City Record covers Hagar, Coloma, Watervliet, and Bainbridge Township.  In the South, Leader Publications cover the southern communities.  These local media outlets cover local news and happenings in our communities and at our schools.  Because of this coverage that goes back generations, natural communities of interest have formed within the distribution areas of these papers.   As alluded to earlier, our schools also play an essential part in our communities of interest.  From the lines of the school districts to their sports teams, our schools in Southwest Michigan are the heart and soul of our communities.  Lakeshore vs. St. Joe, Coloma vs. Watervliet, Michigan Lutheran vs. Lake Michigan Catholic are all rivalries that date back generations.  Splitting up our communities into new gerrymandered districts would help tear apart our community; it wouldn\u2019t bring us closer together.

In North Berrien County, the North Berrien Fire Rescue Department serves our northern townships of Hagar, Watervliet, Coloma, Benton, and Bainbridge. While our Sheriff\u2019s Department has command posts in Niles City and St. Joseph City, splitting our officers into North and South Patrols.

Agriculture in Michigan is more than a $100 billion industry, with our state producing more than 300 commodities on a commercial basis, including tart cherries, blueberries, dry beans, floriculture products, and cucumbers for pickles.  Berrien County is the crown jewel of the fruit belt. Our farmers not only feed the nation but also contribute to our community's booming tourism industry.   It's no secret that farmers' markets are popular.  Almost every town in Berrien County has some sort of roadside fruit stand or weekly farmers market throughout the summer, which are visited by both locals and tourists alike.  As the commission seeks to draw new lines, I encourage you to maintain our agricultural communities.    While the more rural areas of our County grow the product, it's sold in farmers' markets in our cities- creating a symbiotic relationship.  St. Joseph, Bridgman, and Benton Harbor all have farmers' markets or open-air markets which attract vendors from Coloma, Watervliet, and Bainbridge Township.  This natural relationship formed by our Northern Communities is an excellent reason why this commission should maintain Berrien County's Northern and Southern House districts.  Agriculture and Tourism are two of the largest industries in our state, and as decisions are made in Lansing, it's important the representatives we send there have a holistic understanding of our community's naturally occurring relationships.  A coastal community/district may understand the tourism impact but not the agricultural impact, while the inverse may be said about a purely rural district.    As drawn now, we have two districts that include both coastal communities and rural communities that form a natural community of interest in terms of growing our agricultural and tourism industries.  Our representatives, past, current, and future, regardless of party, go to Lansing with a holistic approach and understanding of our state's two largest industries and the benefits they offer our local communities.    I encourage you to take and maintain the districts in a similar fashion so Berrien County can continue sending representatives to Lansing that understand our tourism and agricultural industries \u2013 advancing policies that grow our economy and make life better for every resident of Southwest Michigan.

If this commission splits up municipal lines, it would be the single greatest disservice to the people of Michigan in recent memory.  Currently, municipal leaders closest to the people respond to what they hear from their residents and advance policies that their communities want. These municipal leaders speak with their representatives and senators in Lansing and Washington as the voices of their communities.  Splitting municipalities up would severely water down the influence of communities and ensure that residents' voices aren't heard.  In Berrien County, they've taken it one step further by creating a \"best practices\" committee where municipal leaders gather together to advance common policies that they all support.  When one community applies for a grant, they are supported by all the other committee members.  They understand that when one of them wins, it benefits the entire region.    I'm asking you to preserve municipal lines and not water down residents' voices and stomp on the good work that is already happening in Berrien County.

For example, when I moved to East Grand Rapids in 2000, it was one way, but over the past 20 years I have seen it morph into a very different city.  It actually appears to have more in common with the City of Grand Rapids than the outskirts.  Two specific examples are their support of the Black Lives Matter protests and mandatory vaccinations which are more in line with the city of Grand Rapids than the townships surrounding the city, which tend to be more pro-cop, freedom and liberty focused.  Additionally, tax increases are almost always approved in East, whereas the township have a more tax averse interest.  For these reasons, I would redraw the district to keep similar community interests in line to make it easier and more conducive to a representative (i.e Senator) to speak for their constituents and what is important to those specific voters.

These urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC.   First, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same.   Second, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with.  Cities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues.  Townships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.  Finally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator).   So, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time. Thanks.

(b)\tDistricts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part.  (c)\tDistricts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.  (d)\tDistricts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.  (e)\tDistricts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate.  (f)\tDistricts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.  (g)\tDistricts shall be reasonably compact.  Kent county especially meets the important \u201cCommunities of Interest\u201d criteria for redistricting by the Commission.  Kent County contains the city of Grand Rapids and the suburbs/cities Grandville, Kentwood, Walker, and Wyoming.   Kent County, Michigan's estimated population is 660,560 according to the most recent United States census data.  This is very close to the specified size of a congressional district.  2020 average size target for congressional district nationwide is 775,726.  Michigan population (9,966,555 in 2020 census) divided by 13 districts (one less than current as planned) would dictate an average of 766,658 people per district.  If necessary, borders of the district could be expanded beyond Kent county in any direction to increase population nearer to the 776,658 target.  Suggest that Ionia county (population 64,697) which includes the Grand River corridor could be added as it has the most in common with Kent County.  The county has interconnecting transit services, school systems, freeways and share many community services.  These cities share a water system, sewer system, county services and access to the Grand River and its parks.    The population diversity compares favorably with the state average.  The county is the center of eleven higher education institutions and satellites for the west Michigan region.  Major corporate businesses are centered in Kent county and draw employees from all these communities and thus support the commerce, services and small businesses of these communities.

Grandville, where I live, is on the western border of Kent County.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a sign to tell you when you drive out of Kent and into Ottawa County, but that invisible line makes a difference.    A couple years ago I injured my hand on a Sunday. I asked my phone for the closest urgent care and was directed to a facility in Jenison. They said I needed to see a hand surgeon, but because the med center was in Ottawa County they sent me to one at Holland Hospital , 25 miles away, instead of much closer specialists in Kent County.   Gerrymandered districts that zig zag across county lines cause similar problems. Take the current Second Congressional District.  It follows the Lakeshore except for a skinny, crooked finger that jabs into Kent County and snags voters like me from Grandville, Wyoming and Kentwood. This muffles our voices by burying us under a blanket of lakeshore voices and prevents us from impacting Kent County\u2018s Third Congressional District where we really belong.   I\u2019m glad this commission is committed to drawing compact, contiguous districts with common interests. Grandville and Wyoming could be such a district.  I live on a little neighborhood lake in Grandville, but the people on the other side of the lake live in Wyoming.  That\u2019s how intertwined these two towns are.  Our main drags,  28th street and 44th street, run parallel across both towns. That\u2019s where we shop, and eat out and where many residents work every day.   The combined population of Grandville and Wyoming is roughly the number you are looking for in a House District. So there you have it,  a  perfect house district defined. One down, 109 to go.

There are around 100,000 Latinx people living in West Michigan. In Kent County the Latinx community makes up about 10% of the total population. The Hispanic community in West Michigan is a mix of recent immigrants and multigenerational families with historic ties to the region. We might have differences such as our country of origin, documentation status, skin color, immigration history, but the community connection to the region and shared interests are strong. Most of us speak Spanish (sometimes as a first language, except for our indigenous people), we eat similar foods and share a history.  The community faces many challenges including experience poverty, education systems that do not take us into account, lack of economic opportunities, and an overall lack of representation. The last two years with the pandemic have intensified many of these challenges. According to Kent County data 1 in 7 Hispanic people contracted Covid in the past year, while the number for White residents was 1 in 14  Of course, inequalities did not start with Covid-19, the pandemic just made those inequities more obvious. Financially, we do not fare very well either; 47% of Hispanics in Kent County are unable to pay for housing, utilities, food, or medical care. Educational attainment is another struggle for our youth. It\u2019s difficult to navigate the school system for many parents, as English is not their native language and little to no language access to public information is available to the community.  There is enough evidence that there are many shortfalls in our systems and that we need more than what we are getting. I see it every day at the Hispanic Center of Western Michigan, from people trying to gain employment or those stretching their money and applying for food assistance to make ends meet. As you can see, we are united in our needs, but as you might know too, our votes are divided by lines that do not elevate our collective voice. We have overrepresentation in the things that hurt our community, now we need representation from people who know our struggles, empathize with them, and knows what it takes to make the necessary changes, and honestly, to look like us as well.

They are members of my Jewish community. These areas contain members of my reading groups. I shop in these 6 areas. I attend interfaith activities throughout these 6 communities.

However, I have also learned about gerrymandering.  I admit I identify as a Democrat. When time comes for elections, I am shown maps that look like snakes and individual fingers rather than the palm of my hand. It is only at election time that because of gerrymandered boundaries, I am introduced to foreign names and areas. It is only because of politics and canvassing  that I am asked to leave my community and travel to places like Battle Creek and Greenville and Calhoun and Ionia,and  Barry.I  find it is  only at election time that these places are part of my community and only because  my state and federal,districts include these areas.

It is a beautiful peninsula that lies between Lake Michigan and Lake Macatawa. The Macatawa Park Cottagers\u2019 Association (MPCA) is our volunteer homeowner association. Macatawa itself is not a town, but it does have a post office, a large marina and yacht club. The reason I am writing this testimony is because for decades, the Macatawa community (peninsula) has been split in half horizontally along an imaginary line that is an extension of 32nd Street in Holland, running east to west. Everything to the north of 32nd Street is in Ottawa County and Park Township. Everything to the south is in Allegan County and Laketown Township. What does this have to do with redistricting? Unfortunately, the lines for our Congressional Districts, State Senate Districts and State House Districts were also drawn to follow this imaginary line. So everyone in the north part of Macatawa is in the 2nd Congressional District, the 30th State Senate and 98th State House District. Everyone to the south is in the 6th Congressional District, the 26th State Senate and 80th State House District. We should be represented by ONE person in each legislative body, not two. Some of the issues we are facing are high water on both lakes and severe beach erosion. We had to spend a lot of money on revetment in 2020 and our beach access is still compromised. It makes it more difficult for our community to address this if we have to consult two Congressmen, two State Senators and two State Representatives. I believe Macatawa should be represented together as one,  joined with the beach communities to the south on Lake Michigan and to the east on Lake Macatawa. This is our community where we share the same interests, challenges and activities. 32nd Street (and its extension westward) should no longer be a dividing line.

I believe this COI also includes the City of Holland which is already partially in Allegan County (splitting the city between two districts at the House or Senate level does not make sense) and several of the lakeshore/tourism areas immediately surrounding the city and Lake Macatawa (which forms a natural geographical boundary for this COI). I did my best to make neat borders/clear delineations for the COI boundaries.  Allegan and Van Buren Counties are both primarily rural areas with a heavy economic interests in agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism that stretch from the lakeshore inland toward the eastern county lines. They share functions of government, especially in the criminal justice field, and there is much cooperation between the counties for various services. There are many businesses, farms, school districts, and other entities that cross the county lines and/or operate in both Allegan and Van Buren as well. The small town communities throughout each county and in surrounding areas (such as Schoolcraft and Vicksburg in Kalamazoo Co) are of similar size, economic development, cost of living, and emphasis on local business. Allegan and Van Buren County residents are heavily reliant on both Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo for work, school, entertainment, etc. though they do remain a distinct community with their unique rural interests. Likewise, Allegan and Van Buren County along with their surrounding rural areas share many challenges that are unique to rural areas including: lack of internet service, difficulties providing emergency services, and entirely different infrastructure needs from more urban areas. These counties need representation at the state level that can focus on these specific challenges and interests. The counties also share a large seasonal migrant worker population as well as many Hispanic communities throughout which should be an important consideration for their representation at the federal level.   Allegan and Van Buren counties also form a distinct community from their neighboring counties to the south which rely more heavily on their proximity to the Indiana border. As an example, residents of Berrien or Cass Counties are more likely to work or shop in South Bend, IN rather than Kalamazoo or Grand Rapids, MI.

We  believe the essential economic, education and environmental contributions of hospitals, schools and universities along with our watersheds and waterways need stewardship.  As you draw the lines for state and federal districts,please keep in mind this extremely vital fact:  The Great Lakes system is the largest source of fresh surface water in the world and holds approximately 22% of the planet's freshwater.  Lake Michigan is the largest body of freshwater entirely within the boundaries of the United States (Mi.gov).  The maps we are contributing reflect lines, boundaries and population data of the 33rd Michigan Senate District.  One fifth of the world's fresh water envelopes Michigan; which we must protect.  There are 1400 injection wells in Michigan.  We hope to lessen their existence in Mecosta, Isabella, Clare and Gratiot counties.  These wells threaten aquifers and residential wells, by injecting chemical and radioactive waste under great pressure into old fracking well sites.  There is minimal opportunity to track the status of this subterranean storage.  The first notice:  someone's well is contaminated.    The operation of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) pose a harm from livestock and fertilizer runoff.  Run-off from CAFOs contribute to harmful algae blooms which shut down the sun and disrupt the floors of waterways and the aquatic life of our great lakes.  Our 103 mile-long Pine River runs through five mid-Michigan counties.  The 92 mile long Chippewa River runs through two mid-Michigan counties.   Finally, the 216 mile long Muskegon River runs through seven counties.  All tributaries eventually feed into the Great Lakes.  Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline in the United States.    Alongside the Muskegon River in western Mecosta county, Nestle extracts water faster than the aquifer can recharge itself.  Nestle makes billions of dollars bottling water while paying nearly next to nothing.  They contribute tons of single use plastic bottles of which barely a third are recycled.    Case in point, Flint residents were forced to obtain water via WWII era leaded pipes and were subjected to the highest water bills in the country, while Nestle sold water back to Flint at a huge profit, sacrificing local watersheds for private profit and plastic pollution.    Our Community of Interest includes Mecosta, Clare, Isabella and Gratiot counties together to help maintain in part the Muskegon River Watershed  and the Pine and Chippewa rivers which are part of the Saginaw River drainage basin.  We need to preserve, protect, restore and keep a sustainable use of our waterways.    All the lakes and rivers drain into the Great Lakes.   Whatever we flush, fill up and drain into our Great Lakes affects us all in a myriad of ways.  We feel healthy waterways will add to our economy for today and our future generations.

I ask that you consider educational catchment in your redistricting efforts for the State House district #99.  Mount Pleasant is a town of about 26,000, surrounded by smaller rural communities right in the center of the state. We combine the best of small-town life and university amenities. In our immediate area are Central Michigan University, the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribal College, Mid-Michigan Community College, and Alma College. We provide a wide range of higher educational opportunities to local residents, as well as students all over the region and the state. The Mount Pleasant Public School district has a wide catchment area, including students as far away as Rosebush, Lake Isabella, and Shepherd.   You can help us keep our educational community intact by redrawing the 99th district to include these areas. We provide pre-professional studies in health care and a medical school. We offer resources in STEM fields, language, the arts, history, and anthropology.   Combining these communities into the 99th district will also streamline and simplify economic development including public-private partnerships like the CMU Research Corporation. Opportunities for life-long learning and skill retooling support employment needs for both workers and business. Higher education institutions are a powerful economic driver for the state. Having a strong voice in Lansing to advocate for all of us would benefit us and the region as a whole.  I have submitted plan #21434 for your consideration. Thank you for your time.

We are all active in our community and can say with certainty that we know the history, culture, economics and needs of our area.  We have a school superintendent, student support staff, a county commissioner, pre-school directors, early childhood specialists, entrepreneurs, small business owners, fruit farmers, a judge, members of our local family collaborative, members of our local chambers of commerce, members of our Latino and indigenous communities on our Board. Although our \u201chome base\u201d is Leelanau County, a peninsula hugged by the Grand Traverse Bay and Lake Michigan, our collaborating partners are in Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska Counties.  Much the same can be said of many organizations and businesses located in each of our five-counties.   We ask that our five counties be kept together as a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.   We appreciate all five counties with approximately 172,000 residents could be in one state senate district, but have too great a population to be in one state house district, and too small a population to be the sole composition of a single federal district. However, we believe these five counties share cultural and historical characteristics and economic interests and should be considered a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d and kept together along their county boundaries as much as possible when drawing the new district lines.  Our five counties have common bonds and comprise a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d because we share services, a school district, resources, transportation and the identity as being the broader Grand Traverse Bay Area.  Specifically, LECDC is working on the expansion of affordable, quality child care across the region. All five-counties have inadequate child care to provide for our growing work force. This five-county area has recently been awarded responsibility for the management of the Tri-Share pilot program to address the scarcity of child care in our region.    Also consider the following common bonds. A significant number residents of all five counties: \u2022\ttravel to Grand Traverse County for work; \u2022\tutilize the hospital, doctors and pediatricians located in Grand Traverse County;   Further, we share educational, social service, agricultural and tourism resources: \u2022\tNorthwest Education Services is a five-county region of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Kalkaska schools.   \u2022\tNorthwestern Community College is the area\u2019s post-high school institution. \u2022\tMany local service agencies cover all, if not several, of these counties.  (e.g. Child Advocacy Center, United Way of Northwest Michigan, Northwest Community Action Agency, Great Start Collaborative Traverse Bay, Women\u2019s Resource Center, Area Agency on Aging of Northwest Michigan, Substance Free Coalition of NW Michigan) \u2022\tAll five counties lack adequate, affordable housing and work in collaboration with each other on initiatives to address this concern. \u2022\tOur local circuit court jurisdiction is comprised of Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Antrim counties.   \u2022\tA public transportation system connects Leelanau with Grand Traverse Counties. Actually, the only land routes out of Leelanau County are through Grand Traverse or Benzie County.   \u2022\tThe Traverse Area Regional Trail (TART) trail goes through Leelanau, Antrim and Grand Traverse Counties. \u2022\tThese five-counties all rely on the financial rewards of northern Michigan tourism.  \u2022\tLeelanau and Benzie are the home of the Sleeping Bear National Park.  \u2022\tGrand Traverse, Leelanau, Antrim and Benzie counties share shoreline, sit at the basin of the Grand Traverse Bay and/or the shoreline of Lake Michigan.   \u2022\tArea water protection organizations interact in these shoreline counties.  \u2022\tLeelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim and Benzie comprise the majority of commercial cherries grown in Michigan and 55% of Michigan wine grapes are grown in Leelanau and Grand Traverse Counties.   The broader lower northwest Michigan counties we have included in our state senate and federal house map proposals also share several bonds. Our counties are known for year round tourism: beaches in the summer, skiing in the winter and hunting, camping and the color tour in the fall. The counties that we have included in our map proposals are along main transportation arteries in the northern western Lower Peninsula, namely US 131 and 127. These counties host four major post-graduate institutions: Northwestern Michigan Community College, North Central Michigan College, Central Michigan College, and Kirtland College.    We are all Michiganders, but our five-county region shares so much in common, but not state house and state senate districts.  Currently, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim Kalkaska and Benzie counties are spread over four house districts (the 101st, 103rd, 104th and 106th) and two different senate districts (the 35th and 37th). Our current federal district is the vast geographic District 1 that encompasses 25,000 square miles, all of the 15 Upper Peninsula counties and 17 Lower Peninsula counties.  We are submitting suggestions for state house and state senate. We are also submitting two federal house suggestion: one in the Lower Peninsula and along the west side of the state and one encompassing the Upper Peninsula and along the east coast of the state. Again, we ask that our five counties, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska be kept together as a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.

In the content below you will find that these communities share a mutual benefit of being enveloped into one state senate district. These three communities share a community college (Delta College), a regional-tri-city airport (MBS) and of paramount importance, these communities share vital water infrastructure that serves the needs of the citizens and thousands of local and large businesses (SMMWSC).  Our community will cite the historic, cultural, and the economic impact that we all share from these anchor institutions.   Michigan\u2019s 32nd senate district should include Bay City, the City of Midland and the City of Saginaw for because they hold numerous vital communities of interest:   Delta College Serving Saginaw, Midland and Bay City  Content provided by Delta.edu -Educational Community of Interest   Through the collaboration and innovation of 300 civic-minded individuals who saw the need  for a top-quality community college in mid-Michigan, Delta College was created to serve Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties. Delta College opened in 1961 with 2,600 students, and now enrolls about 9,000 annually. Students range from high school students taking dual-enrollment classes to older adults returning to college to enhance their skills. Today, Delta continues to value collaboration and innovation as we lead the way in community college education. From our involvement as a founding member in the League for Innovation in the Community College to our commitment to Achieving the Dream as a Leader College, Delta College continues to learn and grow as we encourage our students to do the same. The main campus has been expanded and renovated a number of times throughout the years as we continue to offer students the best learning equipment and technology available. And to provide more convenience, Delta College has established three centers in Bay City, Midland and Saginaw.        MBS Airport \u2013 (Midland, Bay City and Saginaw)  Content provided from MBSAIRPORT.ORG       Economic and Historic Community of Interest In the 1930s, a plan to develop an airport to serve the Saginaw Valley and surrounding communities led to the development of Tri-City International Airport, known since 1994 as MBS International Airport. In 1941, a square mile of property was purchased by the cities of Midland and Saginaw and Bay County, in order to build an airport large enough to meet the anticipated needs of the area. However, our country was at war, and wartime needs took precedence. National leaders feared that Detroit Airport, where combat aircraft were being built, could be a target for bombing. As a result, the federal government took over MBS International Airport and added more land, runways and taxiways so that fighter aircraft could be stationed there, if needed, to intercept bombers en route to Detroit. The airport infrastructure benefited significantly from this early infusion of federal dollars. And although MBS International Airport was never needed as an alternative World War II airfield base, it was used for a time as a Prisoner of War Camp, housing thousands of Hitler\u2019s troops. On September 19, 1943, Brig. Gen. Hoyt S. vandenBerg, who was deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Army Air Corps, dedicated the airport before one of the largest audiences in Tri-City history. On June 1, 1946, the airport commission resumed full responsibility of MBS on behalf of the three owning communities, and the airport was opened to commercial aircraft.  In 2005, The Boyd Group International, Inc., an aviation research, forecasting and consulting firm based in Evergreen, Colorado, studied MBS International Airport\u2019s economic impact on the area. The airport\u2019s economic benefit to Midland, Bay and Saginaw counties was estimated to be more than $100 million annually. The direct impact of jobs and property-related revenues was estimated at more than $50 million annually. The report also calculated the savings in time and cost to local users of MBS versus other airports at more than $7 million annually.  The full economic impact study can be found at: http://www.mbsairport.org/pdfs/economic_impact_study.pdf  City of Saginaw & City of Midland Water Cooperative   Economic, Historic, and Cultural Community of interest  Content provided by the City of Midland\u2019s website: Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation \u201cThe Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation (SMMWSC), organized in 1946, operates under Act 233 of Michigan Public Acts of 1955, as a non-profit municipal corporation providing raw Lake Huron water to its owners, the cities of Saginaw and Midland. The corporation is a Michigan Type 1 Public Water Supply and operates within the rules and regulations of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 399 P.A. 1976, as amended. The corporation provides limited treatment and basic disinfection of Lake Huron water before it is transmitted to households, businesses and industry. This high-quality, reliable raw water service has been provided to customers in mid-Michigan for more than 50 years.\u201d Content provided by the City of Saginaw\u2019s website: The City of Saginaw owns and operates a world class water system. This system has been in existence for more than 90 years. Originally the source was the Saginaw River. However, in 1946, understanding the need for an abundant, consistently high quality raw water source, Saginaw in partnership with the City of Midland formed the Saginaw Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation (SMMWSC). SMMWSC chose Whitestone Point as the location to build an intake into Lake Huron. Whitestone Point is located 8 miles North of AuGres, approximately 65 miles from each city. The original system design was for a maximum pumping capacity of 43 million gallons per day (MGD) of which Saginaw would receive 23 million and Midland 20 million. The total cost of the original project was $10.3 million dollars. Over the course of the last 70 years many upgrades have been made to the system. The present day design has a maximum capacity of 115 MGD with an estimated cost to duplicate of $430 million dollars. Because of the foresight of the leaders of both cities, Saginaw and Midland benefit from having one of the best raw water sources in the world. The Great Lakes contain one fifth of the world's fresh water supply. This great source water is pumped daily to both Cities where treatment is provided to produce potable water. Potable water is water that does not contain objectionable pollution, contamination, minerals or infective agents and is considered safe for human consumption.  As you can see, this relationship between the Cities of both Saginaw and Midland has not only historic relevance but also economic benefit. In the fight for resources federally and in Michigan, these communities must be joined together for a fair opportunity for funding and capital infrastructure improvements.

Saginaw, Bay City and Midland are called the Tri-Cities. All three cities are urban/suburban communities with similar history, economy, industry, and environmental interests.  Twenty years ago, Bay County was gerrymandered away from the Tri-County region in terms of state representation. Bay County was joined with Tuscola and Lapeer County to form a state senate district that has been represented by family farmers. As a result, Bay County has little representation of our more urban/suburban concerns as well as environmental concerns. Both Bay City and Saginaw grew up along the banks of the Saginaw River. Ours is a COmmunity that is on the Northern edge of an Industrial Corridor. We share concerns over water quality resulting from heavy manufacturing, the lumber business which opened up this are of the country in the 1800's. The Saginaw RIver is still an important shipping route and one of michigan's only navigable inland rivers. It is wide enough and deep enough for 800 foot freighters to reach the stone docks of Zilwaukee. In Bay County the river is spanned by 4 bascule drawbridges connecting the east and west sides of Bay City.  While industry and boaters rely on river access, the City of Bay City is responsible for the bridges' upkeep and has struggled to maintain them.  This is a tri county concern because movement from one side of the river to the other is necessary for all who live in this area.  Services that were once available in each community are now shared, which requires additional travel and/or commuting.  Goods that are transported to any community do so on roads leading directly from Bay City into Saginaw and Midland, such as I-75, I 10, M-84, The river Road (M-13), and M-47.  Health services are shared among the Atri-Cities. McLaren Bay Region for example, has more than 5000 employees living throughout the Bay Region. Patients move between Bay CIty, Saginaw and Midland for shared services and treatments. In adddition, the Tri-COunties share two important higher education Institutions. Students from each of the Tri-cities and tri-counties call Delta COllege and Saginaw Valley State University home.  There are many reasons to consider the tri-cities, tri-counties a Community . In fact, intercounty commuting was so prevalent that Bay and Saginaw COuntieswere designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as a single Metropolitan Statistical Area in the 1980's.

I now live in Livonia, and my son attended Livonia public schools for his entire K-12 education. I also lived in Plymouth for a short time.  I believe that K12 school districts, especially in the Detroit Metro area, should play a large part in creating communities of interest. Therefore, my map encompasses the Wayne-Westland school district, which now includes parts of Wayne, Westland, and Inkster; it also includes the Livonia district, which includes parts of Westland, and the Plymouth-Canton district, among others.  Beyond school districts, there is some commonality (e.g., average income, age of houses and infrastructure, home value, educational attainment, etc.) among inner ring/older suburbs like Redford, Livonia, and Dearborn as well as long-established western communities like Plymouth, Northville, and Farmington, which are a popular destinations for those living in the western suburbs. Hines Park, which runs through communities such as Dearborn, Westland, Livonia, Plymouth, and Northville, is also a popular gathering place and point of reference. Other important and familiar institutions include Schoolcraft Community College and Madonna University (both in Livonia), Greenfield Village/The Henry Ford and University of Michigan-Dearborn (both in Dearborn), Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, and more.

The Resort Authority was created 20+ years ago as a result of the need to build and maintain infrastructure for the area of Frenchtown commonly called \"The Beaches\".  The physical area stretches from the property where the Fermi III nuclear power plant is to just south of Sterling State Park. A map is attached which outlines most of the Resort Authority Area.  This map was drawn up for the installation of new seawalls around the entire area to protect \"infrastructure\" the RDA has done for the past 20+ years.  It was created due to the tremondous need to replace infrastructure destroyed in numerous flooding situations in the 1970's.  At that time, everything was private - roads, parks, everything.  The roads in the subdivision was never built for heavy traffice and do not meet regular cost for roads.  They weren't paved, there was no central water or sewage, each subdivision (Association) had to pay for their own garbage pick-up, street lighting, road maintenance, canal and bridge maintenance.  The housing stock was primarily 1920-1940 and the homes were mostly built for summer living only.  After the floods, many homes were condemned and torn down, rental housing became prevalent and the area generally went downhill.  With the RDA created, road maintenance, street lighting, drain maintenance became their responsibility and was greatly upgraded.  Generally, the quality of life has gone up.  The RDA also provides funding to the Monroe County Sheriff for patrols specific to the beach areas.  We are in Frenchtown which, is somewhat developed - is still primarily a farming community outside the \"Beaches\".  The Township's priorities are builting a commercial strip miles away from the \"Beaches\" and maintain the farming atmosphere of the remaining area of the township.   Our area is environmentally impacted by the polluting of Lake Erie from primarily the Maumee River in Ohio.  The algae blooms have cut off water to parts of Monroe County.  Our water comes via a pipe a mile off the shore of \"the Farms\" which is the beach association next to us.  The water has to be treated with more and more chemicals in order to make sure the toxins in the algae do not harm us.  The air pollution has been reduced since DTE was forced by the EPA to be \"scrubbers\" on the Monroe Power Plant.  This is a coal-burning plant - the biggest in southeast Michigan, and has the dubious distinction of providing over 90% of the acid rain over southwest Ontario.  We could sit and watch the orange plumes waif across the water towards Canada.  The Fermi II is next door to us and the area is still storing all of the used uranium fuel since Fermi I was built in the 1950's - all of it being stored on that property on the shore of Lake Erie.  I think it's of utmost importance that our community be tied to the downriver communities that also rim Lake Erie and the Detroit River.  The amount of coal-powered power plants in Trenton, Wyandotte, and River Rouge and the pollution in the river and the lake - join us at the hip.

When companies wanted to store giant piles of Pet Coke which was dangerous to all who lived nearby, communities worked together to oppose it. The communities commonly referred to as downriver are attached in an upload here on a map and are Allen Park Brownstown Township Ecorse Flat Rock Gibraltar Grosse Ile Township Huron Charter Township New Boston Waltz Willow Lincoln Park Melvindale River Rouge Riverview Rockwood Romulus Southgate Taylor Trenton Woodhaven Wyandotte Geographic proximity are a given as evidenced by the attached map but the history of community support and shared interests and concerns also makes us a community of interest. We dine, work and travel between our local communities on a daily basis. My husband and I personally live on Grosse Ile, own a business in Lincoln Park, a rental home in Wyandotte and dine in 6 or 7 of the local communities on a regular basis. What happens in one community directly affects another. The \"free\" county bridge that allows access to Grosse Ile near Trenton has been closed for over a year for repairs which has hurt businesses big and small in Trenton and on Grosse Ile. Local hospital traffic has all been rerouted to Wyandotte which affects not only the Wyandotte hospital but the hospital in Trenton who now gets less business because of the closure. Grosse Ile is tiny community of 5,000 homes and about 10,000 people and we rely heavily on our neighbors for many services including the Mutual Aid/Rescue mentioned above. I'm truly not aware of the population limits on districts but Downriver should be kept together as much as possible.

Only about 90% of Downriver is in District 12, while the other 10% (including my city: Melvindale) are in District 13, split from the rest of our tight-knit group of communities.

The same county line also separates State house, senate, and US congress districts in addition to local school and municipalities (Hartland and Highland). There are approximately 400 property owners who live around Dunham Lake in communities planned primarily to conserve the natural beauty of the lake and allow them access to the water via a protected greenbelt.   Dunham Lake is a 110-acre glacial lake that was formed anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 years ago from a block of ice broken off by the retreating glacier - a so-called 'kettle lake'. Dunham has three deep basins, the deepest one about 125 feet, making it one of the deepest, if not the deepest lake in Southeast Michigan.   In the 1920's Henry M. Wallace began buying up all available land around the lake to protect its natural beauty. Henry had heard a talk by the noted Canadian bird enthusiast, Jack Miner, who had a bird sanctuary in Ontario along the migratory flyway. Inspired by Miner, Henry decided to use his Dunham Lake property for the same purpose. Trees were planted caretakers hired and wild rice sown in the shallows of the lake to attract Canada Geese. The area became a State Wildlife Refuge and Federal Game Preserve.   Upon Wallace's death in 1949, a consortium of five businessmen, headed by former governor of Michigan, Murray D. Van Wagoner (1940-42) purchased it in its entirety. However, the seller imposed certain restrictions on the deed. And the purchaser was required to submit a plan to preserve the beauty and purity of the lake. It was Van Wagoner who came up with the idea of the greenbelt and it was incorporated into the development plan as a valuable guard against lake ecosystem degradation.  The greenbelt surrounding 70 percent of the lake varies in width from about 100 to almost 400 feet. Cedar trees, planted in the 1930's, abound as do other conifers, towering hardwoods such as oak, cherry, hickory, and maple, along with berry producing shrubs, a favorite with the numerous birds in the area. Walking paths run along the lake and up on the higher ridges in the greenbelt, allowing residents to enjoy the dense woods, wildlife, and lakefront views. The lake freezes over in the winter creating opportunities for ice fishing, ice skating, and cross-country skiing. The DNR does not allow motors of any kind on Dunham Lake.   Residents from around Dunham Lake conduct their lives in the communities of Hartland, Brighton, Highland, and Milford. Children on the Livingston County side attend Hartland Schools. Children on the Oakland County side attend Huron Valley Schools. Many residents work in Milford at the GM Proving Grounds or own or work at businesses in Hartland, Brighton, Highland, or Milford.

The transportation corridors running north, and south are US23, Pleasant Valley/Fenton Road, Hickory Ridge, and Milford Road.

It's a slower-paced and simpler lifestyle--a lifestyle many of us want to preserve here in LC and is why we choose to live here. We already have more urban and populated counties to the east and to the south of LC, and I believe it's important to preserve the beautiful bucolic rural/agricultural county that we currently enjoy.

Our county's cities, townships, and municipalities should be kept in tact as much as possible for election purposes plus several others.

Michiganders agree that we should be districted together with our community, not for partisan reasons; however, communities of interest will better our government through pre-existing structures like legislative committees.  Once in state government or in Congress, the women and men elected to represent these areas will pursue committee assignments. Elected officials often pursue committees that impact their community. In rural communities, the Agriculture Committee is often desired because that agriculture policy has real impact on the community. If the community is focused around a military instillation, the Armed Services Committee is a great way to serve the community in an impactful way. Similarly, if you live in a community with large universities like UM and EMU, the Education Committee is a terrific way to serve the community. The \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of committees will skew towards different types of communities. It is the reality that elected officials will never be an expert on every type of policy, so our government accommodates this reality by narrowing a focus.  Now, I see proposals to diminish the importance of COIs. Putting aside the significant issues with constitutionality, I want to highlight the negative repercussions from splitting communities. Specifically, some commissioners are dividing communities like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. One proposal grouped Ypsilanti and Monroe, and I\u2019d just want the commission to consider how a representative would fail to adequately represent both communities. Would this Ypsi-Monroe representative pursue the Agriculture Committee and diminish the impact upon Ypsilanti? Would this Ypsi-Monroe representative pursue the Education Committee and diminish the impact upon Monroe? It\u2019s a no-win situation and dilutes the voice of communities in their government. It would be a shame.  While this is a state-wide issue, in my particular instance, I see it as problematic considering the dark history of elevating Ann Arbor\u2019s voice while diminishing the voice of those in Ypsi.   I live right near the \u201cborder\u201d of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, but I don\u2019t see it as border.  This area, both sides of the street, is my community. Splitting us would be a disservice to our voice in government through the committee process. For that matter, I don\u2019t see a significant \u201cborder\u201d with western Wayne County, but I do see a border between rural regions surrounding Washtenaw County though. They deserve fitting representation just like Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti deserve fitting representation.  COIs are so much more important than a mere matter of political preference or \u201chard feelings\u201d between urban and rural communities. There is real impact on our government.

This district is compact, very close knit within the community, and has a very strong balance in partisan fairness. Many communities all across the state have done a great job elaborating on their communities of interest. I have done so myself during my public comment at the Novi hearing in the spring, but now we must look to the broader implications of the maps as they fit together as a whole. There are certain communities within the state of Michigan, that due to their own unique cultures skew heavily to one partisan side or another. These imbalances are not perfect however, and when considering the overall composition of the electoral maps going forward their uneven weight should be mitigated where possible. The main reason why the people of Michigan voted for and demanded that this commission took the reigns of this process is to ensure that no one party had a disproportionate advantage in any given election. If 55% of the population of the state votes for one party, that party should hold roughly 55% of the seats in the house. If in the next election that party only wins 45% of the votes, their seat count should subsequently fall to 45% of the seats. For the last several cycles, the percentage of seats awarded in the Michigan House and Senate have been vastly different than the number of votes cast. To the best of its ability the commission must seek to eliminate these inefficiencies, while considering the many communities of interest the people of Michigan have provided to the commission.

These cities also have a plethora of colleges such as Northwoods University, SVSU, Delta College, U of M - Flint, and many more within the regions. They have many corporations that operate with these areas as well, notably being the Dow Chemical Company, GM (Powertrain), Nexteer Corporation (Saginaw Steering Systems), S.C. Johnson and Sons (Ziploc), and many more. This is a very large working class area that has much industrial history, so these areas should be combined into one congressional district due to these significant. ties.", "areaname": "District 1", "areatext": "", "districtr_id": "28054-1", "cluster_id": "p1426-1"}, {"title": "Tri-Counties/Flint/Genesee Confgressiona", "description": "This map keeps the Tri-Cities (Bay City, Midland and Saginaw) together with Flint/Genesee in a Congressional District. There are numerous reasons to hold this region together in a Congressional District.  Historically these cities emerged in similar fashion.  Together they comprise an industrial corridor that is served by I-75, and the Saginaw, Tittabawasee, SHiawasee, and Flint Rivers. With the decline in domestic manufacturing all of the above communities have experienced reduced revenue to sustain the roads, bridges, and shipping channels of the rivers.   Health and social services are heavily relied on by an aging population. Services that were once present in each community are now shared and coordinated among these cities and townships. So for particular treatments and services, clients will travel to one or the other of the Tri-Cities, as well as to Flint. McLaren Bay Region in Bay City employees more than 5000 people. It is the largest employer in Bay City and is a subsidiary of McLaren Health Care Corp. in Flint.    The Tri-Cities are connected to Flint via the natural waterways. Specifically, the Shiawassee, Tittabawasee, Cass, FLint Rivers are all upstream tributaries of the SAGINAW RIVER. The Greenpoint of the Saginaw RIver is at the junciton of the Shiawassee and Saginaw Rivers. The elevation change from greenpoint all the way to the Bay is 2 feet elevation. That together with the shape, shallowness, wind, etc. will flood the Shiawassee RIver Flats as well as communities along the Saginaw river. While once quarter of the counties in the lower peninsula (22) are in the Saginaw Bay Watershed, it is the counties directly located on Saginaw River and sometimes the Bay that experience flooding. In 1986 that flooding extended all the way back to St. Charles and even Clare. The sewer systems of the watershed communities are the biggest tributaries into Saginaw River/Bay. All of that water flows through Bay County.  The devastating flood in mid-Michigan in 2020 occurred in Midland, Saginaw, Bay and surrounding Counties. That 500 year flood was a result of unusual natural events but especially devastating due to failure of critical infrastructure including the Edenville and Sanford Dams.  The need for government control of critical infrastructure was devastatingly illustrated by these dam failures. It is painfully apparent that policies are needed that protect critical infrastructure and this needs to be Federal.  And finally, there should be mention of the Higher Educational systems that students in all of these communities rely on. In 2016, 45% of students at SVSU were from the tri-counties and Genesee County.  Over 30% were from Bay and Saginaw Counties. Students who call these counties home are being trained in environmental studies to to conduct Field Studies on the Watershed and Rivers of these communities.  In addition the School of Health and Human Services provides professional degree programs for those local students to fill  jobs that are in high demand.  The University and Delta College U of M Flint and Mott Community College benefit from government funding in addition to local support. The illustrated needs of Bay, Saginaw, Midland Counties together with Flint/Genesee are not exhaustive. But I believe they are enough to show that these communities together have  cpncerns unique to their area as well as concerns typical of most cities. The aging infrastructure and population, the urban nature are particular to these 4 cities and their surrounding counties. While at the same time, this area is key to the health of the Great Lakes and we know it. Much is being done to protect our fresh water and the largest freshwater resource in the world. Please enable us to continue to advocate for necessary funding to protect our natural resources and our  residents and area for the future by keeping Bay County, Midland, Saginaw and Flint/Genesee together in a Congressional District.

The surrounding areas are their \u201cbedroom communities.\u201d  For over 50 years, the residential communities of Fenton (which straddles the Oakland-Genesee-Livingston Counties borders), Holly (Oakland) and Schwartz Creek (Genesee) have shared in high school sports competition across county lines; gradually, other nearby districts joined them, including the border school districts of Brandon (Oakland) and Goodrich (Genesee) and most recently, Lake Fenton (Genesee, 2019).  High school sports are an important cultural activity in these areas and have bound these school districts together in friendly rivalry for a long time. \u2022\tShared Interests:  The central cities are de-industrialized today.  They are rebuilding and revitalizing.  Along with their surrounding commuter residential areas they seek economic and employment development.  The economic interests of the residential areas are enhanced when the central cities prosper.  Where the two economic areas of shared interest adjoin, the area of shared sports activity overlaps the county line. \u2022\tPhysical Connection:  The I-75 corridor is the main artery in this part of the state and connects the two areas.  The Flint and Pontiac areas adjoin each at the area served by the Fenton, Holly, Brandon and Goodrich school districts \u2013 all of which, again, compete together in the Flint Metro League. \u2022\tAims:  Improve representation of unique re-developmental and growth needs of these two non-major-metro central cities and the people who live in them or live nearby and work in them, to maximize employment and economic development, and to maintain and reinforce the sense of community that exists at the border between the two counties. \u2022\tA large proportion of the workers who live in this proposed district also work there.  \u2003 Included Central Cities \u2022\tFlint  \u2022\tPontiac  Included Surrounding Areas \u2022\tAll of Genesee County \u2022\tNorthwestern portion of Oakland County generally along or near the I-75 corridor - the equivalent of just over 11 geographical townships \u2013  o\tHolly, Groveland, Brandon, Rose, Springfield, Independence, Orion, Highland, White Lake and Waterford townships, o\tJurisdictions within those geographical townships, including but not limited to (for example) the city of Lake Angelus, the city of the Village of Clarkston, and the city of Holly), and o\tThe cities of Sylvan Lake, Auburn Hills and Pontiac, and  o\tThe entirety of the City of Pontiac School District, including areas served by the district outside the city of Pontiac.  Flint, Pontiac and their respective school districts, and their respective surroundings constitute similar economic hub areas in that they are each a non-major-metro central city with a surrounding residential area.    The interests of these two central cities, their school districts, and their surrounding residential areas are different from those which might be found in a larger, major metro area like Detroit and surroundings.  People in these areas often turn towards the smaller- or more human-scale, away from the \u201cbig city\u201d or \u201crat race\u201d of the metropolitan area, sometimes being a little more \u201chome grown\u201d rather than nationally or globally oriented, and even in the central cities, maintaining some elements of \u201chome town\u201d or \u201csmall town\u201d pride of place.  The city of Flint and its school district might be considered a community of interest by themselves.  The same could be said for the city of Pontiac and its school district.  However, in each case, there are many people who live outside the city/district and depend on work inside it for their financial well-being.  Therefore, a more comprehensive definition of each community of interest is also appropriate.  The representational interests of Pontiac and its nearby areas to the northwest in Oakland County will be better served in combination with those of Flint and its nearby areas in Genesee County than they would be in a Metropolitan Detroit oriented congressional district.  The same is true about combining the Flint & Genesee community of interest with that of Pontiac.  The people living between the two cities relish living away from \u201cthe city.\u201d  With central city, suburban and rural areas, this proposed congressional district would have somewhat greater population diversity than the state as a whole.    This proposed district likely would be a \u201cswing\u201d district in which candidates of either major party could succeed, contributing much to an overall sense of fairness in Michigan\u2019s congressional district map.  Reasons for Excluding Other Adjacent Residential Areas \u2022\tTuscola and Saginaw Counties share more interests with the Tri-Cities area - Saginaw, Bay City and Midland \u2022\tLapeer County shares more interests with other Thumb Counties \u2022\tShiawassee County shares as many or more interests with Lansing or rural counties as it does with Flint \u2022\tLivingston County's interests are split between Lansing and the Detroit Metro Area \u2022\tAreas in Oakland County to the south of the designated area relate much more strongly to the Detroit Metro Area \u2022\tTo the east of the designated area in Oakland County, Oakland Townships, Rochester and Rochester Hills relate more to the Detroit Metro Area (via highways M-24/Lapeer Road and M-150/ Rochester Road), and form their own community of interest, as members of that community have asserted, and along with Addison Township, they relate well to Macomb County communities immediately to their east, in terms of shopping and business patterns.  Whether to include parts of Oxford Township or Highland Township (or both or neither) in this Congressional District is mainly a matter of meeting the equal population requirement.  2020 Census data is not available at the time of this proposal.  For purposes of a congressional district proposal, the Genesee County lines have been used and, in Oakland County, geographical township and city lines.  It is recognized that these jurisdiction boundaries need not be adhered to by the commission, and there is not an exact definition of where community of interest lines must be drawn, particularly on the northern and western sides of Genesee County.  However, it is clear that: \u2022\tmost of the population of Genesee County outside the city and school district of Flint have more in common with Flint than with Saginaw, Lansing or Lapeer; \u2022\tmost people in the designated portion of Oakland County have more in common with Pontiac and northern Oakland County than with Livingston, Lapeer or Macomb Counties, or areas in southern Oakland County or Wayne County; and \u2022\tThe school districts comprising the Flint Metro League, while they comprise a community of interest in and of themselves, also serve to connect the two larger Flint and Pontiac-based COIs.  Analysis  A congressional district with this set of boundaries: \u2022\trespects and includes three communities of interest, \u2022\tcan be defined to meet the 2020 congressional district equal population requirement, \u2022\tincludes a population more diverse than the state as a whole, is contiguous and compact, \u2022\thas equally balanced two-party vote shares - which encourages healthy, competitive elections in the district, and \u2022\twill keep Genesee County whole or approximately so.  Oakland County is too populous to be represented by a single Congressional District.

While these regions are starting points and were determined previously by bureaucrats in DC, as a lifelong Michigander who is familiar with the areas and unique definition of these communities, here are some thoughts to clean these regions up for district drawings. Washtenaw County is much more connected to Wayne county. For example, the University of Michigan has a campus in Ann Arbor (Washtenaw) and Dearborn extension (Wayne).

Agriculture represents a major economic driver, along with many of similar industrial operations such as steel. Much of the rural and agricultural community shares similar values making it easy for elected officials to provide fair representation.    Most importantly, these counties already share many natural and community factors. The Region 2 Planning Commission represents a tri-county area consisting of Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Jackson. The Area Agency on Aging, which I have served on, represents these counties as well.  The River Raisin Watershed displays a natural boundary tying Jackson, Lenawee, and Monroe Counties through environmental shared interests.  Branch, Hillsdale, and St. Joseph County share many of these same interests, while also sharing a regional health department and would be a natural fit to adjoin the already existing relationship between Monroe, Jackson, and Lenawee. Similarly, western Washtenaw shares a makeup of towns and small cities just like the rest of the district and despite the county lines (which my map largely adheres to as to keep matters simple for voters), this area is more similar to the small towns in Jackson, Monroe, and Lenawee, rather than the major metropolitan areas in eastern Washtenaw like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.

I am an involved resident and have served my community on numerous boards and committees. In preparing a congressional map for my area I thought of the things that connected entire counties to make a compact district, though for population purposes I had to add western Washtenaw.  My map includes four border counties (Branch, Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Monroe) which have strong economic interests as border counties. They directly deal with the impacts of differing laws between Michigan, and southern neighbors, Ohio and Indiana. In addition our local paper reaches across these four counties. Hillsdale has a strong independent hospital, but the other three counties are all part of a large hospital system that shares resources.  Beyond these border county connections there are several economic and community interests that connect us north. The Region 2 Aging Agency and Region Plan Commission both cover Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Jackson counties. There are also strong tourism ties related to the Michigan International Speedway which is located where the three counties connect. We also have strong education ties between counties. Kellogg Community College has a satellite location in Branch County, Jackson College and Spring Arbor University have locations in Hillsdale.

The focus of life is different in the country with farmers meeting for breakfast in local restaurants (before the pandemic) to informally discuss farming and local interests before going out to do daily work. Development of the land is looked on with skepticism because it brings the possible loss of farmland and way of life. In the last few years local people have organized and kept several different developments out of the area. We need to keep farmland intact for the nation's food supply. On the other hand, in cities such as Ann Arbor research, development, and expansion are the focus. In the Michigan counties running along the border of Ohio and Indiana each county has its own county fair showcasing livestock and crafts of 4H children and food, etc. Each county is very proud of their individual fairs with friendly competition between them.
