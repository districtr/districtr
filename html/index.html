                  <p>
                    Redistricting is dividing up a jurisdiction (like a state, county, or city) into districts for the purpose
                    of electing representatives. Where and how the lines are drawn influences everything from who is
                    likely to be elected to how resources get allocated.

              <div class="col1">
                <p>Redistricting occurs every 10 years after the Census is released. In most
states, elected representatives in the state legislature are responsible
for redrawing the lines. The process often relies on costly software and
involves little public input.

              <p>The goal of Districtr is to put the tools of redistricting in the hands of the public, with an emphasis
              on meeting the needs of civil rights organizations, community groups, and researchers.
              </p>
              <p>Districtr came about from a conversation with Lawyers for Civil Rights, the Boston arm of the national Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. LCR was describing their work with community members in Lowell, MA, who were frustrated about not having a voice with the city council. In
              those conversations, a few places kept coming up.</p>
              <p>Like Clemente Park, a much-loved meeting point for the city’s Asian and Latino populations, which
              felt unsafe at night because the city had not provided lighting in the park.
              </p>
              <p>And Lowell High School, the city’s only public high school, which serves over 3000 students. The
              city announced plans to move it from its traditional downtown location, but did not invest in substantial outreach to communities of color about possible new sites.</p>
              <p>
              Our idea was to create a mapping tool whose fundamental principle is to ask the community what
              matters.</p>
              <p>With maps that show relevant landmarks and data, users can try their own hand at drawing meaningful demonstration plans.</p>

<p>
<strong>User experience.</strong> Participating in the redistricting process should be easy and enjoyable.
</p><p>
<strong>Openness and transparency.</strong> The entire project is open-source, with permissive licenses. All of the
data used in the app is freely available and well-documented. We explicitly declare where we get
our data, how we’ve processed it, and what we think of its quality.
</p><p>
<strong>Responsiveness to the community.</strong> Different places have different values and priorities when it
comes to drawing districts. We aim to highlight the specific concerns of the community in each
place that we include in the app.
