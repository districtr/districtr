            <li>The evaluation tab allows you to see the racial, voting age population, and partisan balance of the
              communities you are mapping. Some communities pages have additional data for evaluation, such as household
              income and age.</li>

            <h3>Population by Race</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of the population by race in each of your communities, and compare it
                to the overall composition of the state you are drawing in.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Voting Age Population by Race</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As in the previous section, you can compare the percentage of the voting age population by race in
                each community. Voting Age Population (or VAP) is the group of people who are 18 years or older.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Age Histograms, Household Income, and other data</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate additional demographic information, such as age and
                household income, in each community and compared to that of the overall locality. As with the Data
                Layers tab, this information is from the ACS.</li>

            “Share” button once you have shared). You will know when your map is up to date when the button says
            “Saved.” You can keep repeating this process to edit and re-save your map as long as you are in the same

            <li>All maps tagged with an event code will be viewable in a dashboard available to the event organizers.
              Event codes can be used to compile a large quantity of maps for a region, to assess coverage and identify
              areas needing more community mapping, and to compare maps of specific communities. This can be to
              influence official map-drawing, for community organizing, for educational purposes, and more.</li>

            <li>To draw your first district, select the paintbrush icon in the top right corner of the page. Click and
              drag on the map to add units to your district.</li>
            <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts4.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
            <li>To draw another district, select a new color from the color bar directly below the paintbrush icon. Each
              color corresponds to a different district. For pages with large numbers of districts, only one color will
              show when you start. For these, use the “+” button to add the remaining district colors.</li>
            <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts5.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
            <li>To change the size of the brush, drag the brush size slider directly below the color bar or use the

            <li>To inspect districts without altering them, or to avoid painting over already-drawn areas, toggle the
              “Lock already-drawn districts” box.</li>
            <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts8.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
            <li>To correct the boundaries of your districts, click the erase icon in the top right corner of the page.
              Click and drag to remove units from that district. The size of the eraser can be adjusted by dragging the
              slider or using the arrows to its right.</li>
            <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts9.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
            <li>Alternately, click the “undo/redo” buttons to revert the boundaries of your district plan to a previous
              version. You can undo/redo as far back as your most recent use of the paint tool.</li>

            <h4>Coalition Builder</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Using the Coalition Builder tool, you can combine multiple demographic groups of your choosing into a
                shared “Coalition population.” Check off the name of each demographic group you want to add to your
                Coalition, and click again to uncheck and remove a group. Below the selection buttons, you can view the
                total population of the Coalition as well its percent composition of the jurisdiction as a whole.</li>
              <li>Under the “Show population” and “Show voting age population” tabs, select the Coalition population
                from the dropdown menu to display this layer on the map.</li>

            <h4>Socioeconomic data</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Several states and other areas feature socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey (ACS).
                Available features include but are not limited to: homeownership, household income, and broadband
                access. (Note: ACS data can be added to additional localities upon request.)</li>
              <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts17.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">

              <li>Toggle the “Show partisan lean” box and select the desired set of election results from the dropdown
                menu to view partisan lean by unit. Using the dropdown menu for Display, choose to display the data as
                sized circles or shaded regions. Please note that this option is only available when building your
                districts out of precincts.</li>

            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The evaluation tab allows you to see the racial, voting age population, and partisan balance of the
              district plan you’re making. Some districting pages have additional data for evaluation, such as household
              income and age.</li>
            <h4>Population by Race</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of the population by race for districts, relative to one another and
                relative to the overall composition of the area. Use the drop-down menus to compare different races.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Voting Age Population (or VAP) is the group of people who are 18 years or older. As in the previous
                section, you can compare the percentage of the voting age population by race for districts, relative to
                one another and relative to the overall composition of the area. Use the drop-down menus to compare
                different races.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of votes received by the republican and the democratic candidate for a
                variety of elections, by your districts and relative to the overall partisan lean. In places where we
                show candidates by other parties or variation within parties, candidate names and/or parties are listed.
                Note: because we only show two-party vote shares, the overall percentage may differ slightly from
                official percentages, which include third party candidates</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate the age and household income distribution of the
                population in each district. Some areas also have the ability to check the contiguity of the districts
                you have drawn.</li>

          <h2>Sharing your Map</h2>
        </section>
        <ul>
          <li>Clicking the “Share” button saves the map you created and uploads it to the Districtr database. You do not
            need to create an account, and only the information in your map is shared.</li>
          <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts20.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
          <li>As long as you are in the same browser session, you can update this original map, leaving the link
            unchanged. To save changes made to the map, click on the “Update” button (in the same location as the
            “Share” button once you have shared). You will know when your map is up to date when the button says
            “Saved.” You can keep repeating this process to edit and re-save your map as long as you are in the same
            browser session.</li>
          <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts22.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
          <li>Anyone who has the link, including you, can open up the map in their browser and make additional changes
            to it. These changes can be saved to a new link by clicking “Share” again. When the button says “Saved,”
            this means all changes are saved to the new link.</li>
          <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts21.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
          <li>Whenever you need a copy of the link, click on the “Saved” button.</li>
          <li>To download your map, choose from the options in the drop-down menu in the upper right corner. For more
            detail on these, refer to the Import/Export Options page.</li>
          <h4>Event Codes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>MGGG can help you with map collection by setting up an event code for your organization.</li>
            <li>Once you have an event code, you can tag maps with it. When you click “Share,” “Update,” or “Saved,”
              enter the event code and click “Tag your map.”</li>
            <li>All maps tagged with an event code will be viewable in a dashboard available to the event organizers.
            </li>
            <li>Event codes can be used to compile and compare a large quantity of maps for a region. Map collections
              made through events can in turn be used to influence official map-drawing, for community organizing, for
              educational purposes, and more.</li>
