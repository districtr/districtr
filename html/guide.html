              <ul>
                <li>Using the Coalition Builder tool, you can combine multiple demographic groups of your choosing into
                  a shared “Coalition population.” Check off the name of each demographic group to add the group to your
                  Coalition, and click again to uncheck and remove a group. Below the selection buttons, you can view
                  the total population of the Coalition as well its percent composition of the jurisdiction as a whole.

              <ul>
                <li>Several states and other areas feature socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey (ACS).
                  Available data include but are not limited to homeownership, household income, and broadband access.
                  (Note: ACS data can be added to additional places upon request.)</li>

            <h4>Previous elections</h4>

              <li>Toggle the “Show partisan lean” box and select the desired set of election results from the dropdown
                menu to view partisan lean by unit. Using the dropdown menu for Display, choose to display the data as
                sized circles or shaded regions. Please note that this option is only available when building your
                communities out of precincts.</li>
              <img src="/assets/guide/coi/gif/coi17.gif" alt="In the Data Layers toolbar,
              we can also display partisan lean from previous election data offered in a drop down." class="screenshot">
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The evaluation tab allows you to see the racial, voting age population, and partisan balance of the
              communities you are mapping. Some communities pages have additional data for evaluation, such as household
              income and age.</li>

            <h3>Population by Race</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of the population by race in each of your communities, and compare it
                to the overall composition of the state you are drawing in.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Voting Age Population by Race</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As in the previous section, you can compare the percentage of the voting age population by race in
                each community. Voting Age Population (or VAP) is the group of people who are 18 years or older.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Age Histograms, Household Income, and other data</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate additional demographic information, such as age and
                household income, in each community and compared to that of the overall locality. As with the Data
                Layers tab, this information is from the ACS.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/assets/guide/coi/gif/coi18.gif" alt="In the Evaluation Toolbar, we can display data on Population
            and other statistics for each community we draw." class="screenshot">

              Event codes can be used to compile a large quantity of maps for a region, to assess coverage and identify
              areas needing more community mapping, and to compare maps of specific communities. This can be to
              influence official map-drawing, for community organizing, for educational purposes, and more.</li>

              color corresponds to a different district. For pages with large numbers of districts, only one color will
              show when you start. For these, use the “+” button to add the remaining district colors.</li>
            <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts5.gif" alt="We can draw a second district by selecting a different color for

              <li>Using the Coalition Builder tool, you can combine multiple demographic groups of your choosing into a
                shared “Coalition population.” Check off the name of each demographic group you want to add to your
                Coalition, and click again to uncheck and remove a group. Below the selection buttons, you can view the
                total population of the Coalition as well its percent composition of the jurisdiction as a whole.</li>
              <li>Under the “Show population” and “Show voting age population” tabs, select the Coalition population

          </ul>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The evaluation tab allows you to see the racial, voting age population, and partisan balance of the
              district plan you’re making. Some districting pages have additional data for evaluation, such as household
              income and age.</li>
            <h4>Population by Race</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of the population by race for districts, relative to one another and
                relative to the overall composition of the area. Use the drop-down menus to compare different races.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Voting Age Population (or VAP) is the group of people who are 18 years or older. As in the previous
                section, you can compare the percentage of the voting age population by race for districts, relative to
                one another and relative to the overall composition of the area. Use the drop-down menus to compare
                different races.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You can compare the percentage of votes received by the republican and the democratic candidate for a
                variety of elections, by your districts and relative to the overall partisan lean. In places where we
                show candidates by other parties or variation within parties, candidate names and/or parties are listed.
                Note: because we only show two-party vote shares, the overall percentage may differ slightly from
                official percentages, which include third party candidates</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate the age and household income distribution of the
                population in each district. Some areas also have the ability to check the contiguity of the districts
                you have drawn.</li>
              <img src="/assets/guide/districts/gif/districts19.gif" alt="In this example, we show how the evaluation tab
                alerts us to discontiguous units, highlighted for our convenience." class="screenshot">
