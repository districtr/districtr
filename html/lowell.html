                    Welcome to <a href="/">Districtr</a>!  This is a free
                    community webtool for redistricting and community mapping
                    provided by the <a href="https://www.mggg.org">MGGG
                    Redistricting Lab</a> at Tufts University.  We welcome
                    questions and inquiries about the tool and about our work in
                    Lowell: <a href="mailto:contact@mggg.org">contact@mggg.org</a>

                <p>
                    In 2019, all eyes are on Lowell, Massachusetts. The City of
                    Lowellâ€™s at-large electoral system has been challenged in a
                    recent lawsuit (Huot et al. v. City of Lowell et al).
                    Plaintiffs in the case argued that the current system
                    dilutes the votes of Lowell's communities of color for the
                    City Council and School Board. For more information about
                    the lawsuit, read LCR's explainer <a href="https://www.lawyerscom.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lowell-Voting-Rights-Lawsuit-FAQ-Final.pdf">[here]</a>.

                <h2>Election Reform in Lowell</h2>
                <p>
                    This November, Lowell residents will have a chance to vote
                    on a new system! The choices for City Council are (a) a
                    city-wide system electing 9 council members by ranked
                    choice, or (b) 8 districts plus 3 at-large seats, raising
                    the size of the council to 11 members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Read our <a href="https://mggg.org/Lowell-Report">public report</a>
                    on the choice facing Lowell voters this November!  We
                    explain the options on the ballot and some general
                    differences between systems of election.  For more technical
                    explanations of our modeling, refer to our

                <h2>Try Drawing Districts</h2>
                <p>
                    We invite you to use Districtr to draw your own
                    districts and think about some of the tradeoffs for yourself.
                    You can build <strong>3 City Council Districts</strong>,
                    <strong>7 City Council Districts</strong>,
                    <strong>8 City Council Districts</strong>, or
                    <strong>9 City Council Districts</strong> using
                    <strong>census blocks</strong> as the basic building blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (The 8-district option is one of the ones on the ballot this November.)

                    Each of these plans was generated by randomized algorithms,
                    while making sure that the Asian and Latino communities meet
                    the statistical thresholds laid out in the legal
                    requirements, where applicable.
