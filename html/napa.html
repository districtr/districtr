                    Welcome to <a href="/">Districtr</a>!  This is a free
                    community webtool for redistricting and community mapping
                    provided by the <a href="https://www.mggg.org">MGGG
                    Redistricting Lab</a> at Tufts University. We welcome your
                    questions about Districtr and the maps that you create of the City of Napa,
                    Napa County, and Napa Valley Unified School District:

                <h2>Election Reform in Napa</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The City of Napa is switching from electing city council seats at-large,
                      to individual districts each with one or more members.</li>
                      <li>The Napa Valley Unified School District is considering switching from
                      electing the Board of Education trustees at-large, to seven districts
                      each with one member.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This districting process should be open and transparent for everyone,
                    and the chosen district should represent neighborhoods and communities.
                </p>
                <h2>Try Drawing Districts</h2>
                <p>
                    We invite you to use Districtr to draw your own
                    districts and think about some of the tradeoffs for yourself.
                    You can build
                    <strong>4 City Council Districts</strong>,
                    <strong>5 City Council Districts</strong>, or
                    <strong>7 City Council Districts</strong> using
                    <em>census blocks</em> as the basic building blocks.

                    Click on any of the districting plans below to open it in
                    Districtr. Then feel free to start modifying it yourself!
                    Each of these plans was generated by randomized algorithms,
                    while making sure that the Asian and Latino communities meet
                    the statistical thresholds laid out in the legal
                    requirements, where applicable.
