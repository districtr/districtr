## Santa Clara

The units you see here are census blocks. Data for this module were obtained
from the US Census Bureau. The block shapefile for the City of Santa Clara was
downloaded from the Census's
[TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html).
Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the
block level from
[Data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).
The source shapefile with demographic information is available for download from
MGGG's GitHub organization
[@gerrymandr](https://github.com/gerrymandr/Districtr-Prep/tree/master/Santa_Clara).

This module was created because of a lawsuit against Santa Clara's at-large
electoral system for City Council, which plaintiffs claim posed a structural
impediment to the election of Asian Americans. A district court in May 2018
ruled that the voting system violated the California Voting Rights Act (for more
information see
[here](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Court-Rules-Santa-Clara-Violated-the-California-Voting-Rights-Act-482815201.html).
In February 2018, MGGG [released a report](https://mggg.org/SantaClara.pdf) with
recommendations for alternative voting systems in Santa Clara.

unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

## Missouri

The units used here are voting tabulation districts or VTDs. Data for this
module were obtained from the
[Harvard Election Data Archive](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/16795).
The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information about
processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization
[@mggg-states](https://github.com/mggg-states/MO-shapefiles).

This shapefile and corresponding election data are from the 2008 election cycle.
In November 2018, Missouri passed a constitutional amendment that makes the
state demographer responsible for drawing the state's legislative districts,
rather than the state legislature itself. MGGG is currently working to compile a
more recent precinct shapefile with election results, but Missouri is a
notoriously difficult state to do this because of discrepancies between election
results reported by counties and the census provided VTDs.

## Chicago

### Community Areas

The units used here are community areas, which were drawn by social scientists
at UChicago in the 1920s and serve as proxies for neighborhoods. Data for this

In March 2019 the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Rucho v. Common
Cause, in which plaintiffs claim that North Carolina's remedial 2016
congressional map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The 2016 remedial
map had been drawn after the Supreme Court struck down two of the state's 2011
enacted congressional districts as unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. MGGG
and our collaborators filed an amicus brief which can be accessed
[on our website](https://mggg.org/amicus).

## Pennsylvania

The units used here are voting tabulation districts, or VTDs. The raw,
unprocessed VTDs were collected from the Census
[TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html).
Election data was compiled at the precinct level by a private individual and was
found to be within 1% of the official state-reported results at the county and
state levels. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was
downloaded at the block level from
[Data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).
The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information about
processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization
[@mggg-states](https://github.com/mggg-states/PA-shapefiles).

In February 2018, Moon Duchin was asked by Governor Tom Wolf to provide guidance
in evaluating redistricting plans for fairness after the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court struck down the 2011 enacted plan as an unconstitutional partisan
gerrymander. Her report is hosted on
[MGGG's website](https://mggg.org/uploads/md-report.pdf).

## Massachusetts

### Towns

The units you see here are Massachusetts' towns and municipalities. Data for
this module were obtained from the Massachusetts Elections Division website and
the Massachusetts Bureau of Geographic Information (MassGIS). The town shapefile
was downloaded from the
[MassGIS website](https://docs.digital.mass.gov/dataset/massgis-data-community-boundaries-towns-survey-points).
All election data comes from the Secretary of the Commonwealth's
[Elections Division website](http://electionstats.state.ma.us).

This module was created to aid in a paper,
["Locating the representational baseline: Republicans in Massachusetts,"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09051)
written by MGGG and collaborators. Despite Republicans usually gaining between
30% and 40% of the two-way vote share in statewide elections, Massachusetts has
not elected a Republican to the US House of Representatives since 1994. The
paper finds that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not the
result of gerrymandering or candidate availability, but rather is a factor of
the spatial distribution of Republican voters in the state.

### Precincts, 2002-2010

The units you see here are precincts from the 2000 redistricting cycle. The
2002-2010 raw, unprocessed shapefile comes

The source shapefile with demographic information is available for download from
MGGG's GitHub organization
[@gerrymandr](https://github.com/gerrymandr/Districtr-Prep/tree/master/Lowell).

This module was created in response to the current lawsuit (Huot et al. v. City
of Lowell et al.) challenging the City of Lowell's at-large electoral system for
City Council and School Committee. Plaintiffs in the case argue that the current
system dilutes the votes of Lowell's communities of color. For more information
about the lawsuit, read the LCCR's explainer
[here](lawyerscom.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lowell-Voting-Rights-Lawsuit-FAQ-Final.pdf).
