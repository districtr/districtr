# The Tooltip Brush

The Tooltip Brush is a special brush used with the [`InspectTool`] or in community mode where
information on the hovered units is displayed. Like [`Brush`], it extends [`HoverWithRadius`]
and extends its parent class functions. 

## Construction

A `Tooltip` requires the relevant `layer`, `content` for display and `radius`, which defaults to 1.
The `layer` and `radius` is sent to the base class as part of the `super` construction. Parameter
`content` is applied to instance variable `this.content`, an object of `ToolTipContent` type.
Finally, unique for `Tooltip`, a `this.container` instance variable is created set to a new document
div element. This is appended to the container of its `layer`'s mapboxgl `map`, that is, it creates a
leaf div as sibling of the main mapbox gl `map`.

## Activation and Mouse Events

Much of the `Tooltip` simply extends the functionality of its base classes. `activate()` only calls
`super.activate()` whereas `deactivate()` deactivates its super, turns `hoverOff`, sets `this.visible`
to false and renders itself.

> Unfortunately, `this.visible` isn't initialized in the constructor.

`onMouseMove(e)`, the `Tooltip` keeps track of its mouse point with `this.x` and `this.y` (which
also aren't initialized in the constructor.) These are gleamed from event `e`. If there are no
features, we wait a bit an call `this.hideIfNoFeatures`. Otherwise, the tool tip is visible and
rendered. `hideIfNoFeatures()` simply sets the `Tooltip`'s visibility to false if there are no
features and is written here as a timeout callback. _this.render() occurs twice if this happens._

On mouse leave, the super is called, the visibility is set to false and the tooltip is set to
render. 

## Rendering

The trick to loading information in the tooltip occurs when `this.hoveredFeatures` is sent to
`this.content`, which is used to create a display through the `TooltipContent` function. Within
the div in `this.conainer`, an aside tag is created, which must be told how it is rendered. We
do this using two lit-html functions `classMap(...)`, which sets the class, 
i.e. whether hidden or not, and and `styleMap(...)` to set the position.

## `TooltipContent`

Originally written by [@maxhully] on Mon. Apr. 29, 2019, `ToolTipContent` is a function that
takes a list of features and creates a graphic box used for display.

When a `Tooltip` is created by `InspectTool`, a `ToolTipContent` object, the recepient
within `Tooltip` of `this.hoveredFeatures`. It is constructed with the following parameters.

- `features`,
- `columnSet`,
- `nameColumn`,
- `pluralNoun`,
- `parts`, 
- `columnSetIndex`.

This function handles the calculation of the total and the sum over all columns of the entire
list of hovered features. There's also alternative ways of handling elections, alternative
sources of population and different 2018/2019 totals.

Finally, to render, it returns an html that combines both the `tooltipHeading(...)` and a
`HorizontalBarChart(...)`.
