# The Story of [Districtr]
In the name of Democracy, "Districtr is a free, public web tool for districting and community identification, brought to you by the [MGGG Redistricting Lab]." Districtr allows citizens to draw maps and calculate demographics to help with the drawing of districts large and small.

This app was born on Sat. Aug. 18, 2018. What began with [@maxhully]'s Sept. 2018 [Mapbox] experiments has bloomed into a vital app that many citizens and state redistricting comissions rely on for governing the district boundaries that in turn, govern us. Over time, many creative minds in Mathematics, Computer Science, Geography and Politics have converged to promote transparent and good governance as a new decade is born. 

As of June, 2021, Districtr is managed by MGGG, a research group at the Tisch College of Civic Life, at Tufts University near Boston, Mass., led by Principal Investigator, Moon Duchin, Associate Professor of Mathematics and her dedicated [team].
