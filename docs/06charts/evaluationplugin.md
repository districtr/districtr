# The Evaluation Plugin 

The `EvaluationPlugin` is part of the default plugins loaded when the
aim is to draw a plan with districts, as opposed to drawing
[communities]. The tab's primary responsibility is to hold data tables
that calculate population or partisanship across drawn districts.
Controls for displaying contiguity is also found here. 

Began as part of plugins pack, April 23, 2019 by [@maxhully]. Maintained
by [@mapmeld] since March, 2020, who added contiguity check in March and
Age Table in April. [@jenni-niels] adds [VRA] functionality in the
Spring of 2021 and both maintain with help from [@jdeschler] ever since.

## [/src/plugins/evaluation-plugin.js]

The evaluation tab runs through an [`editor`]'s [`state`] [context/plan]
through series of case conditions that determine what components to load
in the "Evaluation" tab of the `Toolbar`. 

First, a `mockColumnSet` is cretaed to include a user-specified
coalition in the columns of a population. Then each component is loaded
by condition. 

- Default Reveal Section "Population by Race" featuring
[`RacialBalanceTable`] including `mockColumnSet` 
- "Voting Age Population by Race" `RacialBalanceTable` if `state.vap`
- "Citizen Voting Age Population by Race" `RacialBalanceTable` if `state.cvap`
- "Partisan Balance Summary" `PartisanSummarysection` if any `state.elections`
  - "Election Details" `ElectionResultsSection` if any `state.elections`
  - "Age Histograms" [`AgeHistogramTable`] if `state.ages`
- [`ContiguitySection`] if permitted by [`spatial_abilities`] and is not
`ma_towns`. 
- Other Tabs Related to [VRA]

# #

### Suggestions

- Two equivalent if statements `state.elections.length > 0` should be
combined.
- Initial `isOpen` states can be delegated to a helper function.
- One can simplify the contiguity if statement as this plugin is never 
called if `problem.type` is "community"
- Separate out VRAtab as new plugin.
