# The Population Class

The `Population` Class is a descendent of the [`ColumnSet`] class, which
makes it a simpler sibling of the [`Election`] class. It is found in
[`src/models/Population.js`].

## Constructor

Just as `ColumnSet` does, `Population` takes `subgroups`, a `total`,
a `total_alt` and `parts` usually found in the original context/plan.
In addition, it takes a `name` and the name for its alternative, 
`name_alt`, used for specific absentee-total interpretations. These
final two are set as instance variables.

In addition, an ideal value, `this.ideal`, calculates an ideal
district size presuming equality among all districts of the areas
total population and a formatted version, `this.fomattedideal.`

## Instance Functions

Both `deviations()` and `indiciesOfMajorSubgroups()` are bound
functions of each object.

The `deviations()` function simply
returns a list of the difference between a district's total and
the ideal value as a percentage of the ideal population. 

In addition to the claim in the original documentation for
`indiciesOfMajorSubgroups()` below, subgroups whose name
includes 2018 and 2019 is also excluded, and only three
groups are always returned.

```
/**
 * Returns the indices of all subgroups with more than 5% of the total
 * population, sorted largest-to-smallest.
 */
 ```

# #

### Suggestion
Both `indiciesOfMajorSubgroups()` and `RacialBalanceTable` filter out
2018 and 2019 data. Could this be consolidated?
