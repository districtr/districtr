# My COI

File `my_coi.js` creates a special set of layers which the
`data-layers-plugin` loads for states with the `load_coi` 
permission in `spatial_abilities`.

Within `utils.js`, this appears never to be set true and is
only set false for states CO, CT, IN, LA, MD, MO, NE, PA and VA.

_deprecated!_
