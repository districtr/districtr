# My COI

File `my_coi.js` creates a special set of layers which the
[`data-layers-plugin`] loads for states with the `load_coi` 
permission in [`spatial_abilities`].

Within [`utils.js`], this appears never to be set true and is
only set false for states CO, CT, IN, LA, MD, MO, NE, PA and VA. Since
it is never used, it appears to be deprecated.
