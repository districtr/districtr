# PlacesList

Sometimes, a full or partial list of available places or modules
is required. Located in `src/components/PlacesList.js` are
functions that use `mockapi.js` to help us traverse through
available modules for presentation to the user using class `PLacesList` 

## Listing Places

The common way to collect modules, for landing pages, events and such,
is the function `listPlacesForState(...)` that is called to reutrn an
objects of objects. In essence, this function returns the result of
function `listPlaces(...)` in `mockapi.js`, filters the results whether only communities are required and by US state. 

### `listPlaces(placeID, stateName)`

Within `/src/api/mockApi.js`, a simple function takes two arguments,
`placeID` and `stateName` to traverse the `/assets/data/modules/` folder.
The `stateName` is most vital in this operation as module json files
are organized by this name. In fact, if a `placeID` has no `stateName`,
object `lookupState[placeID]` in `lookupOldState.js` is used to provide
one.

Other than `PlacesList.js`, function `listPlaces(...)` is only ever called
by `routes.js` where it is used to lookup modules by `placeID` that are
loaded by JSON or by CSV. If `placeID` is null, then all places in a state
are returned.

> The function in `mockApi.js` replaces the `listPlaces()` function provided
in `src/api/places.js`. 

## Class `PlacesList` and function `PlacesListForState(...)`

These were both once used in the more full featured version of
`PlacesMap` but have since been deprecated. 

## Helper and Communities Functions

The `community.js` view uses the `onlyCommunities()` function to set
what appears to be a global variable `justCommunities` to true. This
variable is used by function `communitiesFilter(place)` to select
places where their `districtingProblems` indicate that it is coi
oriented.

Similar functons that check module feature are `getUnits(...)`.

A pair of functions are responsible for rendering in the document.

This includes, the `problemTypeInfo` const which generates information
for `multimember` and `community` type problems and `getProbleminfo(...)`,
which is deprecated.

Function `placeItems(...)`, once used more heavily in the deprecated
Class `PlaceList`, is used in `event.js` to generate event cards.

### Suggestions

Currently, the role of `findPlaces.js` is to find
and match modules. This requires traversing the
entire folder of modules. This takes a lot of effort
but is done only once, so we live it. 

Object `spatial_abilities` is the next closest thing
to a master list of modules. Instead of using an 
API, could we extend `spatial_abilities` such that it is a master list of modules?

For instance, we expend effort trying to extract modules related to
communities and localities, though in other parts of the code, this is
handled by `spatial_exceptions`.

We see the benefits of this when considering the
function `lookupState` from `lookupOldState.js`, used
by `listPlaces.js`, where modules are matched up to the 
state they belong to, but this function is not updated 
when new modules are added. 

In addition...

- Originally, in folder `/src/api`, `places.js` was
used to traverse modules. That has since been
replaced by `mockApi.js`. 
- Class `PlacesList`, with its html rendering, was
once used in a more full featured version of 
`PlacesMap` which has since been deprecated.
- Function `placeItems(...)` was once used in `PlacesList` but is now
only used when view `event.js` produces cards for plans. Could this be
similar to the cards already generated in landing pages elsewhere?
- `getProblemInfo(...)` also doesn't appear to be used anymore
