# The Districtr Model for Plans, Contexts, Assignment etc..
 
<img src="../pics/plancontext.png" width=50%>

Districtr keeps track of data regarding a specific area in a JSON format
that's shared internally as a context. The seeds of this format date
back to [@maxhully]'s  initial November 2018 attempts to load into our
Mapbox server. This story is detailed in the commits of repository
[`MGGG/districtr-process`], which is responsible for helping us upload
geographic data.

The structure of our plans are as follows...
 
 ## Identifiers
 
- `id`, Alphanumeric id individual plan
- `name`, Display name of City, County or State, loaded into the State
Portals
- `state`, State where area is located.
- `idColumn`, An object with `key`, `name` pair that identifies the id
column for base unit identifiers.
- `place`, an object pair with its own `id` and `landmarks`, an object
that contains landmarks created when identifying communities of interest
- `placeID`, Id of relevant geographic area, used throughout Districtr.

## Assignment and Parts
- `assignment`: The assignment of precincts, blocks or other units to
districts are kept in this object. This objects assigns a unit
identifier as a key to a single or array of integers corresponding to
the parts the key is assigned to, e.g. `{"001-AAA": [1] "001-AAB": [1],...}`.
- `parts` is an array list of simple objects. Each objects lists a
zero-based `id` and its real-world, one-based `displayNumber`.

## Units
Units can be precincts or block groups and hold the important settings
on which areas a user can paint over. 

 - `units` is a list of Objects of the following specification.
     ## Unit Identifier
     - `id`, identifier used throughout districtr, e.g. `"blockgroups"`
     - `name`, front-facing display name
     - `unitType`, designates whether precincts, Census units, etc.
     - `limit`, optional parameter, can limit display to `"community"`
     or `"hide"`
     ### Column Sets
     `columnSets` is a list of different data tables relevant to this
     context. JSONs without `columnSets` can still be loaded by
     Districtr. Each Object in the `columnSet` list has...
     - `type`, typically `"population"`
     - `name`, display name for `type` like `"Population"` or
     `"Voting Age Population`" or `"Households by Renters"`
     - `total`, an Object of summary statistics like column `key`,
     display `name`, `sum` and range `min`, `max`
     - `subgroups`, a list of many Objects representing non-total
     columns that mirror the `total` Object.
     - `idcolumn`, an Object of pair `name` and `key` that identifies
     the index column (and without `sum` and range)
     - `bounds`, An array of two arrays, of bounding box coordinated
     auto-populated by `districtr-process`.
     - `tilesets`, Very important pair of objects containing mapbox
     address of shapefiles to be rendered by the Map. Contains one of
     `type` `"fill"` and `"circle"`, each bearing a `source` object with
     a `type`, usually vector, and `url` mapbox:// address of the
     geometry. 

## Districting Problems
- Back at the top level, we have `districtingProblems,`an array of
various "problem" objects, typically for `"Congress",
"State House", and "State Senate". Each problem has a `"name"`,
`numberOfParts` and a `pluralNoun` for display. For instance,
[`Alabama.json`] has three "problems," one each for its 7 Congressional
Districts, 105 State House Districts and 35 State Senate seats.
