# The State Object
_Commentary by [@gomotopia], May 2021_

The current state of a plan is kept in data objects akin to those
prescribed in the districtr-json [plan/context]. These contexts are read
into [`edit.js`] and stored as a [`State`] object which interacts with
the [`Toolbar`] and [`Map`].

## [`src/models/State.js`]
The State object is kept as a model in its own [`State.js`] file. This
dates from about Nov 2018, written by [@maxhully]. [@mapmeld] took over
its maintenance since September of 2019. 

### Imports
Important imports include...
- `addLayers` from [`map/index.js`]
- The [`IdColumn`] class
- Utilities like `assignUnitsAsTheyLoad` from `./lib/assign`,
`generateID` from [`utils`]
- Column utilties from [`./lib/column-set`]
- Layer functions from [`map/Layer`].

## The `State` Class
The `State` class formally retains context information read into
districtr and keeps track of changes made by the toolset, like brushing.
It is called in [`edit.js`] when `loadContext()` is ready to complete and
is collected by the [`Editor`] object with a corresponding [`MapState`].

It's construction relies on the [`MapState.map`] Mapbox object, ready for
use within the HTML DOM, an *experimental `MapState.mapswipe`*,
the important context/plan JSON object and a `readyCallback` function,
currently set in `edit.js` to rename the window title.

The important context districtr-json format contains
information about the current plan's `place`, `problem`, `id`,
`assignment`, `units` and more. Each of these pieces are kept in
instance variables like `this.unitsRecord` and `this.place`.

Meanwhile, an `IdColumn` is created based on the parameter context 
`units` and the `State`'s instance `this.plan` is created by providing
a new object of type `DistrictingPlan`. 

A complete list of instance variables are as follows. 
- `this.unitsRecord`, from `districtr-json.units`
- `this.place`, `districtr-json.place``id`,`landmark` pair
- `this.idColumn`, `districtr-json.idColumn` identifier of base units
- `this.plan` as `DistrictingPlan` object and updates district
assignments.
- `this.columnSets`, keeps `districtr-json.columnSets` objects
- `this.subscribers`, usually Editor Object's render function `
- `this.update`, bound to the `update` instance method
- `this.render`, bound to the `render` instance method

Instance method `this.initializeMapState(` acts to intialize a new Layer
for the `Map` object using function `addLayers`, which requests
parameters `map`, `swipemap`, `unitsRecord`, `layerAdder` and
`borderId`. The map state initializers returns the following values that
are then assigned as instance variables for the `State` object.
- `this.units`, the same as unitsRecord?
- `this.unitsBorders`
- *`this.sweipeUnits`, experimental*
- `this.coiunits` and `this.coiunits2` if used for COI
- `this.counties`
- `this.layers`, which looks for `units`, `points`, `bg_areas`, 
`precincts`, `new_precincts` and `tracts` layers
- *`this.swipeLayers`, experimental*
- `this.map`, the map itself, as DOM object.

Finally, `state.numbers` is not initialized here, but generated by
`NumberMarkers`.

State keeps the following instance methods apart from its `constructor`
and the `initializeMapState` functions.
- `activeParts()` returns DistrictingPlan parts that are set to visible.
- `parts()`, returns all DistrictingPlan in the plan. 
- `problem()`, specific DistrictingPlan speficiation on offices and
district numbers
- `serailize()`, returns a json format string of the current map state
- `subscribe(f)`, subscribes external subsribers to be rendered with
state
- `render()`, for lit-html, renders each subscriber into template
- *`hasExpectedData(feature)`, experimental feature.*

## The `DistrictingPlan` class
The `DistrictingPlan` is the first in a set first suggested by
[@maxhully] in future refactoring.

A `DistrictingPlan` requires or generates an `id`, a `state`, a
`problem`, an `assignment`, a `place`, a number of `parts` with caveats
for mutlimember of community type problems and saves them as instance
variables.

Methods include...
- `update(feature, part)` assigns a single feature to a district part
- `serialize` which returns a a portion of the districtr JSON object

### Observations and Suggestions

On Mon., Apr. 22, 2019, [@maxhully] suggested that this State class be
broken up, as mentioned above.

```
// We should break this up. Maybe like this:
// [ ] MapState (map, layers)
// [ ] DistrictData (column sets) ?
// [x] DistrictingPlan (assignment, problem, export()) ?
// [ ] Units (unitsRecord, reference to layer?) ? <--- really need this
one
// "place" is mostly split up into these categories now.
```

Finally, `State.initializeMapState(...)` calls and returns from only one
function. Is it needed?
