# The Team

<img src="../../assets/new_logo.jpg" width=50%>

The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group was founded by Associate
Professor of Mathematics, __Moon Duchin__. This group, within the
Tisch College of Civic Life, applies advanced geometric and topological
research in mathematics towards pressing issues in Civil Rights and
Fair Representation. 

The Districtr App was first developed by __Max Hully__, [@maxhully],
in the fall of 2018. He led development until the Fall of 2019. Since
then, __Nick Doiron__, [@mapmeld] leads development with
__JN Matthews__, [@jenni-niels]. 

To fulfill our aim to provide geographic data of the highest quality
and integriy, we followed the lead of lead geographers __Ruth Buck__,
[@RKBuck1] and afterwards, __Heather Rosenfeld__, [@heatrose]. 

As the project has grown, we have relied on project managers
__Liz Kopecky__ and __Jamie Atlas__, [@AtlasCommaJ], to deploy districtr
in service to a variety of state and local organizations, government
and commissions. They have helped both trained hundreds of ordinary
citizens on ways they can participate in their redistricting processes
and work with nearly a growing list of state governments and
local organizations.

In addition to those above, the code reflects contributions, in 
rough chronological order, from...
- Anthony Pizzementi, [@apizzimenti]
- Chris Gernon, [@ChrisKGernon]
- Zhenghong Lieu, [@lieuzhengong]
