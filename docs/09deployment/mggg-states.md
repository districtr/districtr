# Intro to MGGG-States

MGGG-States is an organization on github found at
[github.com/mggg-states](https://github.com/mggg-states). It was
maintained by [@maxhully] during his time with MGGG and is currently
maintained by [@InnovativeInventor]. It is a collection of repositories
for each state that contain vetted shapefiles for many states and
information on their sources. Note that districtr's mapbox database
carries more geodata than those listed in this organization.

Other than shapefiles, this organization contains repository
[geodata-prep-template](https://github.com/mggg-states/geodata-prep-template)
with a template for sourcing data, written by [@apizzimenti].

The majority of the following shapefiles were first created by
[@RKBuck1] with ample support by [@heatrose]. Recently, [@JDeschler]
has been adding dual-graphs and [@nerdgear] has been pulling some
repositories in anticipation of updates.
