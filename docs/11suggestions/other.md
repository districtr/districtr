# Things that remain left unsaid

- Districtr thanks its look to the sass and css back end. There's also
a variety of functions related to color.

- [@AtlasCommaJ] is currently building an end to end testing regime.
Districtr was originally built to test with [mocha and chai] as written
in the npm package.json.

- Typical workflow involves home development using `npm build` and
`npm develop` and prototype development involves a pull request to
github from which Netlify can generate a deploy preview.

- Uploading modules to add more problems and plans to districtr has its
own which can be gleamed from [district-process]

-  Sign-In forms and authentication was originally planned for the site
but has since been deprecated.

- Many state portals have been constructed over time using this back
end.
