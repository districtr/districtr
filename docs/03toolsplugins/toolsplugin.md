 # Tools-Plugin, the King of Plugins

As described in [`Toolbar`], different problems require a different
sets of tools which must be loaded into the `Toolbar` section of the
[`Editor`]. The `edit.js` view provides a list of plugins to the
`Editor` which are then created depending on whether the editor
 is being used to paint districts or identify communities of interest.
 
The first plugins were written by [@maxhully] on Tues., Apr. 23, 2019.

## Loading Plugins

Specifications on which plugins to include are defined by 
`src/views/edit.js` and are handed to the `Editor` object. On
construction, the `Editor` object calls each plugin function, which
requires a reference to the Editor object.

# [src/plugins/tools-plugin.js]

The basic slate of tool plugins, always loaded no matter whether
we work with painting districts or communities of interest, is 
loaded by `tools-plugin.js`. Created with the first batch of 
plugins in the Spring of 2019, this file is actively maintained
and expanded by [Jamie], [Nick], [Jack], [Anthony] and [JN].

## The tools-plugin function
Tools-plugin is responsible for rendering certain tools in the `Toolbar`
navigation [menu], creating [Brushes], handling contiguity checks and
district numbers and some [`community`] and [`vra`] mode functionality.
This file also happens to defines a list of `Menu` functions for the
`Toolbar`. 

### Important Imports

The tools-plugin handles the important job of coordinating tools that
Brush and Erase with the [`Map`] cavnas and the data/info `Toolbar`.
Thus, nearly all tools must be imported here.
- Tools like the [`BrushTool`], [`EraserTool`], [`InspectTool`],
[`PanTool`], and [`LandMarkTool`] 
- Map Brushes like the [`Brush`], [`CommunityBrush`] and
[`HoverWithRadius`]
- Additional Map layers like [`NumberMarkers`]
- Advanced Map functions like [`ContiguityChecker`] and
[`VRAEffectiveness`]
- User display [modals]
- Server functions from [`routes`]
- Utilities and settings like [`spatial_abilities`]

### Rendering Tools

Users encounter the full functionality of districtr tools in the
`Toolbar`, known to this function as `editor.toolbar` or simply
`toolbar`. This basic set of tools, imported from elsewhere, then
instantiated and stored in a list, is as follows...

- `PanTool()`, for simple map panning
- `BrushTool(brush, state.parts, brushOptions)`, which colors the map
with a given set of plan districts and options.
- `EraserTool(brush)`, which erases assignment made by the Brush Tool.
- `InspectTool(state.units...`), which allows users to view tabular, 
unit by unit information. 

Each tool is added by the `toolbar`to itself and from then on, it is the
`toolbar`'s responsibiity to manage the selection of each tool by the
user. Each tool also has an associated hotkey, and the `toolbar` is also
loaded with `Menu Options` depending on the State.

### Brushes

Many tools above require an instance of a brush, so before these tools
can be rendered, a `brush` instance must be created. There's two kinds, 
a `CommunityBrush` and a regular `Brush`, which require the
`state.units` and a default radius. The following brush behaviors are
also tied together...
- On "colorfeature", we call back `state.update`
- On "colorend", we call back `state.render` and `toolbar.unsave`

Brush options are also set, informing the Brush if the problem type is
a `community`, whether we're `spatial_abilities` permits us to paint
with counties, and thus supplying `HoverWithRadius(...)` functionality
and the special case in Louisiana where our counties are known as
parishes.

Finally, if `community` is selected, we create a new
`LandmarkTook(state)`.

### Additional Functionality

New functions are implemented when they are tied to the brush's on
`"colorop"` callbacks.
- First, we always `savePlanToStorage`.
- For district numbers display on a screen, we create `NumberMarkers`,
saved directly to the window, and toggle their operations to checkbox id 
`toggle-district-numbers`. 
- If `spatial_abilities` permits contiguity check, a `ContiguityChecker`
is created which specifies knowledge of the current UI`state` and 
`colorsAffected` by the discontinuity such that a list is diplayed in
the toolbar. 
- If we're in vra mode, the `VRAEffetiveness(state, colorsAffected)`
function is loaded. 

### Other Functions

This `tools-pugin` also contain other helper functions which are used in
Menu Options.

- `exportPlanAsJSON(state)` serializes the current plan into text and
directs the browser to download this as a .json file
- `exportPlanAsSHP(state, geojson)` serializes the current plan, alerts
the user in a model, and relies on a `routes` server function to provide
a zipped SHPfile package.
- `exportPlanAsAssignmentFile(state, delimiter = ",", extension = "csv")`
and `exportPlanAsBlockAssignment(...)` are similar functions that
provide csv files.
- `scrollToSection(state, section)` navigates back to the state portal
- `getMenuItems(state)` returns a lists of these functions and more for
display in the menu section of the browser.

### Suggestions

- The logic for selecting which tools to plug in, based on
`state.problem`, `spatial_abilities` and more, are scattered throughout
the code. Is there a way to consolidate this logic?
  - In `view/edit.js`, before the `State` is created,
`context.problem.type` determines the list of plugins to load. No matter
the logic, `tools-plugin` is always loaded, while other plugins are
swapped in and out.
  - Within ` tools-plugin`, different kinds of `Brush` are created
whether the `state.problem.type` is community or not. 
  - If `state.problem.type` is communtiy, the `LandmarkTool` is created.
  - `state.problem.type` is passed in as a `brushOption` even if the
Brush is already of `CommunityBrush` or regular `Brush` type.
  - Contiguity Check and VRA does not apply in `community` mode
  - Menu words are chosen on `community` type
  For VRA
   - The`showVRA` option is defined twice. The `VRAEffectiveness` module
   is loaded if `vra` mode is applied. 
- Since the `Toolbar` is created in `Editor` after the `State` object is
created and `Menu` only relies on problem/context `State` to provide a
list of menu options, should Menu functionality be separated out into a
different file?
