# UI and Display Components

<img src="../pics/ui.png" width=50%>

Many different files and components come together to display and
provide user interaction for many of districtr's many tools and
datasets. 

## User Interface components
User interface components are used by both tools and charts (which
include tables.) User Interface options related to tools are rendered by
each Tool's Option Class when each [`Tool`] is loaded by the `Toolbar`.
One example of this are the undo and redo buttons tied to brush
functionality in [`UndoRedo.js`]. 

### Checkboxes 

There are two ways for checkboxes to be rendered into districtr. The
first way is direct, like the `BrushLock` and `CountyLock` in [`Brush`].
These two render functions are nearly identical to the `toggle` function
found in [`/src/components/Toggle.js`]. 

The hard coded functions create a div of class `ui-option` rendered in
the Options  Container. Inside, both the hard coded functions and the
`toggle` function produce a label tag of class `toolbar-checkbox` within
which is contains a tag input of class `.toolbar-checkbox`. This
checkbox inbox has the following attributes...
- `id`, an optionalId provided for in `toggle`
- `type`, in this case always "checkbox" 
- `value`, which is found in the hard coded functions
- `?checked`, a `lit-html` form for setting a checked or not boolean,
`checked` in `toggle` or hard coded like `locked` in `BrushLock`
- `@change`, a `lit-html` form for tying a callback on change events,
with event `e`sent to the parameter `onChange` in the `toggle` or hard
coded like the `toggle` parameter in hard coded `BrushLock`.

Finally, after the close of the input tag, a description is included
before the label tag closes. 

Listeners for these checkboxes can usually find these elements by label
class or input ids. 

### Brush Options

More options for the brush is rendered by the `BrushTool` when
constructed by the `tool-bar.js`. When this tools is created, the
integer number of problem parts is sent it as the number of colors, as
each color really represents an integer that represents a painted
district or community of interest. 

The [`/src/components/Toolbar/BrushColorPicker.js`] is a radio-type list
of colors rendered in the [`OptionsContainer`]. The default function
renders a square color with active listeners ultimately tied back to the
[`BrushTool`], that calls this function. Within this file, the default
function uses helper function `addNewColorButton(...)` that allows for
adding new colors, when used with communities of interest.

The [`/src/components/Toolbar/BrushSlider.js`] is even simpler.
Also created with `BrushTool`, it takes a default `radius`, a callback
function and other options to render inputs of both class `.slider` and
`.slider value.` This callback function is always `changeRadius(e)`
found in `BrushToolOptions`.

### Select 

The `Select` Component, found in [`/src/components/Select.js`], is an
implementation of an html drop-down menu. The full code is listed below. 
```
import { html } from "lit-html";

export default function Select(items, handler, selectedIndex) {
    return html`
        <select @change="${e => handler(parseInt(e.target.value))}">
            ${items.map(
                (item, i) => html`
                    <option value="${i}" ?selected=${selectedIndex === i}
                        >${item.name}</option
                    >
                `
            )}
        </select>
    `;
}
```
Simply, the `Select` componenet is a lit-html style function that takes
`items`, operates upon a `handler` and sets a default `selectedIndex`.
Each item is assigned an index and its name is listed as an option. On
change, the `handler` function is called with the selected value derived
from event `e`. To demonstrate its typical use, we use an example from
the `ElectionResultsSection`. 

```
Select(elections,
       index => dispatch(actions.changeElection({ index })),
       uiState.elections.activeElectionIndex)
```
In this example, an object of `elections`, essentially
`state.elections`, is passed as the list of objects. The callback is a
dispatch to an `action` related to elections and the default active
index comes from `uiState`, which we presume is the [`UIStateStore`]
object `editor.state`. 

### Parameter
The `Parameter` function renders a list typically related to assembling
coaltion of races. The entire code is listed below.
```
import { html } from "lit-html";

export const Parameter = ({ label, element }) =>
    html`
        <div class="parameter">
            <label class="parameter__label ui-label ui-label--row"
                >${label}</label
            >${element}
        </div>
    `;

export default Parameter;
```
While space is made for a `label`, which is sometimes blank, the
`element` input here is usually more complicated. For instance, in 
Coalition Builder, the `element` is a complete series of html component
checkboxes and labels built from `window.coalitiongroups`. In this case,
`Parameter` is a complex, section-type list element rather than a single
selected variable.

### Suggestions

- `Parameter` has a confusing name. It behaves like a "DropdownItem".
- It also has a complicated use as it can be sent anything as its 
display object.
