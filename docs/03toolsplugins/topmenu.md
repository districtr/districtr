# The Top-Bar Menu
Much of the top-bar Menu is contained within the [`Toolbar`] and
[`tools-plugin.js`] files. The Menu made its debut on Mon., Nov. 12,
2018 when [@maxhully] introduced export functionality.

## Opening and Closing

When a [`UIStateStore`] is created by the [`Editor`], the initial state
includes the default for `dropdownMenuOpen`, which is `false`. The work
of revealing and hiding the menu is performed by `Toolbar`, when the
`DropDownMenuButton` is rendered. This button makes dispatches which
ultimately report to the UI state store. 

The actual rendering and hiding of the html element is acheived when the
`DropDownMenu`'s class is update. An designation of class
`.reveal-hidden` tells the Menu to hide.

## Loading Options

Remember, the `Toolbar` only creates the space for tools and functions.
It is the `tools-plugin.js` that breathe life into the space by
populating the appropriate tools. This includes responsibility for
calling `toolbar.setMenuItems` and defining `getMenuItems`. 

Menu items for all cases are relatively the same, differing little
except for [state] or [problem/context]-specific links. Many call out to
functions found in [routes.js].

- "About redistricting", navigates to state-page "why?" section using
`scrollToSection` defined in `tools-plugin.js` 
- "About the data", similarly navigates to to state-page "data" section.
- "Save plan", which opens the [`renderSaveModal`], visible on mobile
phones
- "Districtr homepage", returns to homepage with confirmation box
- "New plan", navigates to `/new` url 
- "Print / PDF", simple print from the window
- "Export Districtr-JSON", uses `routes.exportPlanAsJSON(state)`
- "Export Plan as SHP", uses `routes.exportPlanAsSHP(state)` mindful to
inlcuded `COI` in title if warranted
- "Export Plan as GeoJSON", similar as above, with `true` parameter sent
to same function indicating GeoJSON
- "Export assignment as CSV", uses
`routes.exportPlanAsAssignmentFile(state)`
- "Export block assignment file", uses
`routes.exportPlanAsBlockAssignment(state)` if units are Block Groups
- "About import/export options", sent to `/import-export` url in new tab

### Suggestions

`Menu` does so much by itself, I think it deserve a separate file from
both the `Toolbar`, `tools-plugin.js`. The menu and its options are
loaded only once and the options change little from context to context.
